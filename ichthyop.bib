abstract = "Historically, pelagic Sargassum were only found in the Sargasso Sea. Since 2011, blooms were regularly observed in warmer water, further south. Their developments in Central Atlantic are associated with mass strandings on the coasts, causing important damages and potentially dispersion of new bacteria. Microbiomes associated with pelagic Sargassum were analysed at large scale in Central Atlantic and near Caribbean Islands with a focus on pathogenic bacteria. Vibrio appeared widely distributed among pelagic Sargassum microbiome of our samples with higher occurrence than previously found in Mexico Gulf. Six out the 16 Vibrio-OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit), representing 81.2 ± 13.1% of the sequences, felt in cluster containing pathogens. Among the four different microbial profiles of pelagic Sargassum microbiome, Vibrio attained about 2% in two profiles whereas it peaked, in the two others, at 6.5 and 26.8% respectively, largely above the concentrations found in seawater surrounding raft (0.5%). In addition to sampling and measurements, we performed backward Lagrangian modelling of trajectories of rafts, and rebuilt the sampled rafts environmental history allowing us to estimate Sargassum growth rates along raft displacements. We found that Vibrio was favoured by high Sargassum growth rate and in situ ammonium and nitrite, modelled phosphate and nitrate concentrations, whereas zooplankters, benthic copepods, and calm wind (proxy of raft buoyancy near the sea surface) were less favourable for them. Relations between Vibrio and other main bacterial groups identified a competition with Alteromonas. According to forward Lagrangian tracking, part of rafts containing Vibrio could strand on the Caribbean coasts, however the strong decreases of modelled Sargassum growth rates along this displacement suggest unfavourable environment for Vibrio. For the conditions and areas observed, the sanitary risk seemed in consequence minor, but in other areas or conditions where high Sargassum growth rate occurred near coasts, it could be more important."

Our results show that the accumulation/dispersion areas of the floating and buoyancy neutral particles are practically the same, although the latter are distributed in the water column, 80\% of them found in the photic layer (average depth of 35m). Regarding to the densest particles, they rapidly sink and reach the seafloor close to their source. The regions of higher temporal variability mostly coincide with the ML accumulation regions. Weak seasonal variability occurs at a sub-basin scale as a result of the particles redistribution induced by the seasonal variability of the current field.</p>

As goods and services from marine life continue to retrogress under the intense human exploitation and changing global environment, resilience could be supported through establishment of a functionally connected network of marine reserves across maritime jurisdictions. While the establishment of protected areas within the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) is expanding, mechanisms that would allow governments to conserve marine areas beyond national jurisdictions are currently inadequate. Consequently, implementing marine reserves is largely confined within territorial waters, high connectivity among contiguous maritime zones notwithstanding. As the global focus shifts toward achieving sustainable development goals for the oceans, there is a need for region-specific approaches to area-based biodiversity conservation that extends the scope of protection to areas in the high seas beyond the EEZ. Using simulations of functional connectivity and seafloor geomorphology, we present and apply in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region a contextual approach to regional marine conservation planning to inform a more effective regional marine conservation across maritime zones.</p>

Additionally, we evaluated the possibility to expand the drifters data using trajectories of GPS-buoy equipped drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). The observed and simulated trajectories were compared in terms of spatial distribution, velocity distribution and a nondimensional skill score. For the drifters and FADs, the GlobCurrent and OSCAR products lead to similar performances as the CROCO model-ouputs in the broad studied domain. In the Gulf of Guinea, however, the CROCO model performed significantly better than the other two because the parent solution of CROCO benefited from its communication with a child grid of finer resolution in this region. On average, the simulations lead to an underestimation of the drifter and FAD velocities, likely because the spatial resolutions of the forcing products were insufficient and the time frequency at which they were produced were too low to resolve the relevant oceanic processes properly. We found a low skill for all models to simulate FAD trajectories, possibly because of the devices vertical structure that prevent FADs from drifting like water parcels. Our results therefore suggest that in the Tropical Atlantic the FAD dataset may not be appropriate to use for corroborating Lagrangian simulations.</p>

A biophysical individual based model (IBM) of larval transport was coupled to a regional high-resolution physical model to estimate the monthly and interannual variation of larval connectivity, as well as the impact of the length of the reproductive period on it. Larval connectivity showed marked interannual variations, which were mainly related to interannual changes in seasonal winds and associated ocean circulation patterns, particularly during La Ni{\~n}a years. The southernmost area where E. brasiliensis occurs only received larvae from the nearest release area in November and January spawning events during a strong La Ni{\~n}a year, characterized by intense northeasterly winds. The Uruguayan coast constitutes the leading (poleward) edge of the distribution of E. brasiliensis, where climate change effects are projected to intensify.

Variability in circulation and behaviour produces variation in larval transport with consequences for recruitment. A biophysical model was used to simulate early larval dispersal of Celtic Sea herring (Clupea harengus) during wintertime in 6 years (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010). After 30 days, particles occurred in three areas: inshore Celtic Sea, offshore Celtic Sea, and southern Irish Sea, with the majority (70\%\&ndash;78\% on average) of particles retained in the Celtic Sea. Inclusion of tidal forcing increased transport to the Irish Sea and decreased transport offshore, as did release during a spring tide. Retention in the Celtic Sea was increased by diel vertical migration and decreased by horizontal diffusion. Strong and frequent west to southwest winds increased transport offshore, while strong and frequent east to south-southeast winds increased inshore retention in the Celtic Sea and transport into the Irish Sea. The study shows how tides, winds, and behaviour influence larval transport and retention and highlights potential impacts of climate change on population persistence.</p>

	abstract = {<p>The influence of ocean currents on marine population connectivity is critical to territory planning, and such phenomena should be considered in the design and implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs), marine spatial planning strategies, and restoration plans, among other developments. Knowledge of the influence of currents is also vital in understanding the relationship between oceanographic drivers and ecosystem configurations. However, despite their importance, ocean currents and their role in coral connectivity remain poorly constrained in the Seaflower Marine Reserve, an area that hosts the most productive open-ocean coral reef system in the Caribbean and that was declared a biosphere reserve in 2000. We herein characterize the larva transport patterns associated with surface currents that control connectivity in the reserve. To achieve this aim, we simulated the advection of buoyant coral larvae of Acropora palmata during nine spawning events. Larval dispersal patterns were obtained through offline coupling of a high-spatiotemporal resolution hydrodynamic field and a biophysical Lagrangian model for particle dispersion. Ocean current fields were generated using a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) that was appropriately configured for the region. Larval dispersion was simulated using an Individual-Based Model (Ichthyop). Our results show that there are heterogeneous connectivity patterns during the spawning events at seasonal and inter-annual scales. This seems to be associated with high spatiotemporal dynamic variability in the region, such as the Caribbean Current bifurcation close to the Nicaraguan Rise, the intrusion-formation of mesoscale and sub-mesoscale eddies, and the semi-permanent presence of the Panama-Colombia Gyre. We also found that Serranilla, Providencia, Quitasue\&ntilde;o, and Serrana act as the most important sinks. In contrast, the northernmost reefs, Serranilla, B. Alicia, and B. Nuevo, seem to be the most important sources of larvae, highlighting that these areas need to be incorporated into the current MPA zonification and that this could lead to the improvement of MPA effectiveness. Our findings also suggest the need to implement MPA networks between Jamaica and Colombia to allow biological populations to become resilient to environmental changes and less prone to local extinctions.</p>

	abstract = {Understanding larval connectivity patterns is critical for marine spatial planning, particularly for designing marine protected areas and managing fisheries. Patterns of larval dispersal and connectivity can be inferred from numerical transport models at large spatial and temporal scales. We assess model-based connectivity patterns between seamounts of the Southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO) and the coastal ecosystems of Mauritius, La R{\'e}union, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa, with emphasis on three shallow seamounts (La P{\'e}rouse [LP], MAD-Ridge [MR] and Walters Shoal [WS]). Using drifter trajectory and a Lagrangian model of ichthyoplankton dispersal, we show that larvae can undertake very long dispersion, with larval distances increasing with pelagic larval duration (PLD). There are three groups of greater connectivity: the region between the eastern coast of Madagascar, Mauritius and La R{\'e}union islands; the seamounts of the South West Indian Ridge; and the pair formed by WS and a nearby un-named seamount. Connectivity between these three groups is evident only for the longest PLD examined (360~d). Connectivity from seamounts to coastal ecosystems is weak, with a maximum of 2\% of larvae originating from seamounts reaching coastal ecosystems. Local retention at the three focal seamounts (LP, MR and WS) peaks at about 11\% for the shortest PLD considered (15~d) at the most retentive seamount (WS) and decreases sharply with increasing PLD. Information on PLD and age of larvae collected at MR and LP are used to assess their putative origin. These larvae are likely self-recruits but it is also plausible that they immigrate from nearby coastal sites, i.e. the southern coast of Madagascar for MR and the islands of La R{\'e}union and Mauritius for LP.},

	abstract = {<p>The southern hake, Merluccius australis, is one of the most important marine fishery resources in Chilean Patagonia. However, little is known about its early life history, especially the transport of eggs and larvae and the connectivity between spawning and nursery areas. An individual-based model (IBM) of the early life stages of M. australis, coupled to a hydrodynamic model, was used to track virtual individuals released from known spawning locations and identify potential nursery areas. The simulations were used to assess connectivity and retention of M. australis eggs and yolk-sac larvae within (and between) the continental shelf (offshore) and the inner sea (inshore) zones. The inshore zone included two spawning and nursery areas (Inner Sea of Chilo{\'e} (ISCh), Inner Sea of Moraleda Channel ISM)) and the offshore zone included three spawning and nursery areas (Guafo Island, Guamblin Island, and the Taitao Peninsula). The hydrodynamic model was validated using available observations (oceanographic surveys and the World Ocean Atlas 2018) for winter and spring, periods during which M. australis reproductive activity peaks. The IBM reproduced well the observed seasonal variability of egg and larval distributions. Individuals from the offshore spawning areas had low connectivity with those in the inshore nursery areas in winter and spring. However, individuals from the inshore spawning areas showed a high degree of connectivity with one of the offshore nursery areas (Guafo) during winter and spring, but low connectivity between the inshore ones (ISCh and ISM). Guamblin (in winter) and ISCh (in spring) were the most important retention areas. A conceptual model is proposed to represent the connectivity in early developmental stages between the spawning and nursery areas of M. australis: ichthyoplankton is transported from inshore to offshore in winter when little spawning occurs inshore, but not in spring when spawning and retention increases inshore. Retention in the offshore zone in winter is significant, with almost no connectivity with the inshore zone. Since the main spawning of the species occurs in winter in the offshore zone and secondarily in the inshore zone in spring, the seasonal differences in dispersal patterns seem to be part of the reproductive strategy of the species, which apparently confers advantages for the offspring by promoting development in the most advantageous feeding environment for each season (offshore in winter and inshore in spring).</p>

Therefore, the biotic and abiotic environmental conditions experienced by paralarvae control recruitment strength. To benefit from the favorable environments (i.e. nursery grounds) in the dynamic pelagic domain, paralarvae rely on passive retention by currents to remain in suitable nursery habitat. To evaluate the retention conditions for tropical arrow squid (Doryteuthis pleii) paralarvae off the South Brazil Bight (SBB, 22\&ndash;29 \&deg;S), we ran a series of particle-tracking Individual-Based Models (IBM) coupled to a 3D Princeton Ocean Model (POM). We forced the hydrodynamic model with observed satellite data obtained from January 2000 to December 2010. The IBM-POM models considered two transport scenarios: (1) passive Lagrangian transport and (2) Diel Vertical Migration (DVM). The results show a high retention on actual and putative nursery grounds that could retain paralarvae in a suitable environment for survival, growth, and ultimately to recruit to the adult population. Moreover, model outputs showed high correlation between autumn-winter retention indexes and spring-summer commercial and artisanal landings in the following year. Considering the nine-month post-hatching lifespan of the species, autumn-winter retention indexes potentially provide forthcoming adult biomass predictions.</p>

	year = {2020},
	pages = {102269},
	abstract = {<p>Starting in 2011, coastal areas of the Caribbean Sea and tropical Atlantic Ocean began to experience extraordinary yearly accumulations of pelagic Sargassum brown alga. Historical reports place large quantities of Sargassum only in the North Atlantic (mostly in the Gulf of Mexico and the Sargasso Sea). Accumulations of Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic have continued. We used a numerical particle-tracking system, wind and current reanalysis data, drifting buoy trajectories, and satellite imagery to determine the origin of the Sargassum that is now found persistently in the tropical Atlantic. Our analyses suggest that during the extreme negative phase of the winter 2009\&ndash;2010 North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), unusually strong and southward-shifted westerly winds explain the transport of Sargassum from the Sargasso Sea (\&sim;20\&ndash;40\&deg;N, 80\&ndash;20\&deg;W) into the far eastern North Atlantic. Our hindcast Sargassum distributions agree with surface current simulations with the inclusion of \&ldquo;windage\&rdquo;. Windage is the additional, wind-induced drift of material floating at the free surface resulting from direct wind forcing on the sea surface, as well as on floating or partially-submerged objects. In our simulations, windage is included as an added vector (speed and direction) to the model-computed surface ocean currents equivalent to 1\% of surface wind velocities. Lagrangian analysis of the regional circulation suggests that (1) part of the Sargassum subsequently drifted to the southwest in the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and entered the central tropical Atlantic, arriving in the Caribbean by the spring of 2011, with (2) another portion continuing southward along the coast of Africa in the Canary Current, eventually joining the seasonally-varying system of tropical Atlantic currents and thereby delivering a large Sargassum population to the tropical Atlantic. Since then, Sargassum patches aggregate from March to September in massive windrows along the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) under the action of converging winds. The windrows follow the ITCZ in its seasonal northward migration in the central tropical Atlantic. They are stretched across the central tropical Atlantic as the ITCZ crosses the latitude of the seasonal formation of the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC). These patches and windrows are exposed to high sunlight and open-ocean upward flux of nutrients due to eddy and wind-driven mixing in the central tropical Atlantic. During the northern spring and summer, as the Sargassum drifts farther north with the ITCZ, large portions of the population are advected into the eastern Caribbean Sea. Some of these patches remain dispersed as the ITCZ migrates southward, and re-aggregate into new windrows as the ITCZ intensifies the following March-April. If wind mixing is strong and the mixed layer is deeper than about 50\&ndash;60 m in the southern tropical Atlantic at this time, the Sargassum will bloom and form a massive windrow. Otherwise, the bloom will be inhibited. The extreme 2009\&ndash;2010 NAO wind anomaly could be considered as triggering a biosphere \&ldquo;tipping point\&rdquo; that caused important ocean-scale ecosystem changes in the tropical Atlantic, with significant recurrent social and economic consequences. Understanding whether this new expanded geographic range of massive Sargassum blooms is temporary or whether it will revert to its pre-2009 distribution requires sustained monitoring and research.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Environmental variability can be an important factor in the population dynamics of many species. In marine systems, for instance, whether environmental conditions facilitate or impede the movements of juvenile animals to nursery habitat can have a large influence on subsequent population abundance. Both subtle differences in the position of oceanographic features (such as meandering currents) and major disturbances (such as hurricanes) can greatly alter dispersal outcomes. Here, we use an ocean circulation model to explore seasonal and annual variation in the dispersal of post-hatchling Kemp\&rsquo;s ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempii). We simulated the transport of 24 cohorts of young-of-the-year Kemp\&rsquo;s ridley sea turtles dispersing from the three primary nesting areas in the western Gulf of Mexico to describe variability in transport during the main hatching season and across years. We examined whether differences in transport distance among Kemp\&rsquo;s ridley cohorts could be explained by hurricane events. We found that years with high numbers of hurricanes corresponded to shorter dispersal distances and less variance within the first 6 months. Our findings suggest that differences in dispersal among sites and the impact of hurricane frequency and intensity could influence the survivorship and somatic growth rates of turtles from different nesting sites and hatching cohorts, either improving survival by encouraging retention in optimal pelagic habitat or decreasing survival by pushing hatchlings into dangerous shallow habitats. Considering such factors in future population assessments may aid in predicting how the potential for increasing tropical storms, a phenomenon linked to climate change, could affect Kemp\&rsquo;s ridley and other populations of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

The western gyre predominantly accumulates floating debris in summer. After the integration of the main cyclonic current in winter, the debris in the inner basin moves east. Retention zones along the south-western coast persist in time. The mean particle stranding time is estimated at about 200\&nbsp;days. Accumulation zones along the south-eastern and eastern coast are abundant in summer, and then move further northeast and north. Simulations demonstrate an increasing litter accumulation in summer on the North Western Shelf and shelf break.</p>

	abstract = {<p>A mechanistic understanding of organismal movement provides context for existing biogeographic and ecological patterns and improves our ability to predict changing patterns in dynamic environments. Here, we examined the movement ecology of pelagic Sargassum in the northern Caribbean Sea, where major inundation events of this brown algae have become increasingly problematic to coastal communities. We used GPS-trackers affixed to Sargassum mats, standard oceanographic drifters, and \&ldquo;pseudo-Sargassum\&rdquo; drifters to acquire empirical data on the movement of Sargassum and ocean currents. We related these observed movements to ocean surface velocity fields from a global ocean circulation model and wind velocities derived from models and satellite observations. Specifically, we assessed whether adding a windage component to ocean surface velocities improved predictions generated by synthetic particles tracked within an ocean circulation model. We found that the inclusion of a windage factor of 1 to 3\% reduced separation distances between synthetic particles and the tracks of Sargassum mats, pseudo-Sargassum drifters, and un-drogued oceanographic drifters. When similar analyses were conducted for oceanographic drifters with drogues centered at 15\&nbsp;m depth (which are designed to minimize the influence of winds and waves and thus served as a control for this technique), inclusion of a windage factor did not improve particle-tracking predictions. These findings indicate that adding a windage calculated from satellite-derived winds to the surface layer of an ocean circulation model produces particle-tracking results that are more relevant to Sargassum, likely by accounting for the buoyant nature of the algae and the influence of the direct forcing of wind (and waves, implicitly) on the part of the object extending above the surface. However, the estimates of an appropriate windage coefficient for Sargassum may differ depending on the wind and surface current products used as well as the particular oceanic region being studied. Future work to identify and resolve systematic biases in the representation of winds and currents will be an important step toward eventually forecasting Sargassum movement and coastal inundation events.</p>

A case in point is the Portuguese man of war (Physalia physalis) (Linn{\ae}us, 1758), which despite being pleustonic and remarkably conspicuous, is one of the least studied and understood gelatinous zooplankton species, especially in terms of its ecology. During August to October 2016, the Irish coastline experienced the largest mass stranding of P. physalis in over 150 years. At the same time, P. physalis were recorded offshore in the Porcupine Seabight. Here we used these stranded and offshore observations of P. physalis to inform a Lagrangian particle-tracking model forced by wind to 1) hindcast the backwards drift of this species for three months to determine their likely origin and provide some insights on likely pathways to Irish shores and, 2) forecast the drift of this species towards the Irish coastline. Hindcasting stranded P. physalis from the Irish coastline suggested that they most likely originated from an extensive source area located over the European basin but ultimately from the North Atlantic Current. Our forecast model indicated that particles released from the Porcupine Seabight stranded on Irish shores, in fact, stranding patterns were 82\% similar to actual strandings. Both models combined suggested that the Porcupine Seabight was an important source area, but that many P. physalis likely originated from further south and took a more tortuous trajectory towards Ireland determined by wind. This study also highlights the value of collecting routine beach strandings data and opportunistic offshore visual observations to inform future coastal and shelf modelling studies.</p>

Integrated management strategies aimed at ensuring long-term service provision to society do not currently consider the importance of dispersal and larval connectivity. A spatial optimization model is introduced to maximise the potential provision of ecosystem services in coastal areas by accounting for the role of dispersal and larval connectivity. The approach combines a validated coastal circulation model that reproduces realistic patterns of larval transport along the coast, which ultimately conditions the biological connectivity and productivity of an area, with additional spatial layers describing potential ecosystem services. The spatial optimization exercise was tested along the coast of Central Chile, a highly productive area dominated by the Humboldt Current. Results show it is unnecessary to relocate existing management areas, as increasing no-take areas by 10\% could maximise ecosystem service provision, while improving the spatial representativeness of protected areas and minimizing social conflicts. The location of protected areas was underrepresented in some sections of the study domain, principally due to the restriction of the model to rocky subtidal habitats. Future model developments should encompass the diversity of coastal ecosystems and human activities to inform integrative spatial management. Nevertheless, the spatial optimization model is innovative not only for its integrated ecosystem perspective, but also because it demonstrates that it is possible to incorporate time-varying biophysical connectivity within the optimization problem, thereby linking the dynamics of exploited populations produced by the spatial management regime.</p>

	journal = {Fisheries Oceanography},
	volume = {29},
	year = {2020},
	pages = {137-151},
	abstract = {<p>Abstract This study applied a previously used Lagrangian individual-based model (IBM) for sardine in the Southern Benguela to an improved and more robust hydrodynamic model to investigate whether a more representative spatial coverage, greater horizontal and vertical resolution, more realistic winds and improved representation of mesoscale features such as eddies and filaments would give different results for transport and retention of early life stages. Despite major differences between the old and new hydrodynamic models, overall the IBM results were quite similar to the previous southern Benguela sardine IBM study. This surprising result indicates that it is the macroscale circulation features resolved by the two hydrodynamic models that are controlling transport and retention of sardine early life stages. The contribution of transient mesoscale features such as eddies and filaments appears to be less important when transport patterns are averaged over the 21-year-long experiment. Another aim of this study was to better estimate the contribution of south coast spawning to west coast sardine recruitment. This was possible because of an eastward extension of the geographical domain of the new hydrodynamic model which provided a more realistic representation of the south coast spawning ground. Three main spawning and nursery area systems, similar to those identified in the previous sardine IBM, were identified: west coast and west coast (WC-WC), south coast and west coast (SC-WC), and south coast and south coast (SC-SC). Spawning area proved to be an important determinant of modelled retention and transport success, with spawning depth also playing an important role on the west coast. The main difference observed from the previous study was an increase in the average percentage of particles released on the south coast and transported to the west coast (P0, 17.4\%). This indicates more connectivity between the southern and western sardine stocks than previously thought and is therefore important for fishery management. Standardized anomalies from the modelled retention/transport were compared with recruitment estimates from stock assessment models but there was no correlation between the two sets of anomalies. However, a significant correlation was observed between the modelled retention/transport anomalies for the west coast and total cumulative upwelling anomalies for the Southern Benguela (r\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;\&minus;0.67, p\&nbsp;\&lt;\&nbsp;.001).</p>

Eight ghost nets were collected in the Maldives and estimated drift times ranged between 7.5 and 101\&nbsp;days. Additionally, Lagrangian simulations identified drift trajectories of 326 historical ghost nets records.

Interestingly, ghost nets drifting less than 30\&nbsp;days however, remained inside the exclusive economic zone of the Maldivian archipelago highlighting potential illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity is occuring in this area. This study therefore points to the urgent need for gear loss reporting to be undertaken, especially by purse seine and gill net fisheries in order to ascertain the source of this major threat to marine life. This should also be coupled with an improvment in the data focused on spatial distribution of the abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear originating from both large- and small-scale fisheries.</p>

A high-resolution biophysical model is used to investigate a previous hypothesis that the onset of a particular circulation of the South-East Madagascar Current advects fresher and nutrient-rich waters eastward, feeding the bloom. The model is able to reproduce an intermittent phytoplankton bloom with large spatial variability but in the subsurface layers, as well as the presence of an irregular retroflection of the South-East Madagascar Current. The simulated bloom occurs within a shallow stratified mixed layer, with fresher waters at the surface, parallel to the water mass in an observed bloom. The model results suggest, from a nutrient flux analysis, that horizontal advection of low-salinity nutrient-rich Madagascan coastal waters can indeed trigger a phytoplankton bloom. The coupled model is also able to resolve a bloom that is atmospherically forced by cyclonic activity.</p>

We simulated dispersal of 25 cohorts (1993{\textendash}2017) of oceanic-stage juveniles by tracking the movements of virtual hatchling sea turtles released in a hindcast ocean circulation model. We then used estimates of annual hatchling production from Kemp{\textquoteright}s ridley Lepidochelys kempii (n = 3), green Chelonia mydas (n = 8) and loggerhead Caretta caretta (n = 5) nesting areas in the northwestern Atlantic (inclusive of the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and eastern seaboard of the U.S.) and their stage-specific mortality rates to weight dispersal predictions. The model{\textquoteright}s predictions indicate spatial heterogeneity in turtle distribution across their marine range, identify locations of increasing turtle abundance (notably along the U.S. coast), and provide valuable context for temporal variation in the stranding of young sea turtles across the Gulf of Mexico. Further effort to collect demographic, distribution and behavioral data that refine, complement and extend the utility of this modeling approach for sea turtles and other dispersive marine taxa is warranted. Finally, generating these spatially-explicit predictions of turtle abundance required extensive international collaboration among scientists; our findings indicate that continued conservation of these sea turtle populations and the management of the numerous anthropogenic activities that operate in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean will require similar international coordination.</p>

The nearshore area in southwest Bristol Bay (Alaska, USA) is hypothesized as having historically (i.e., prior to\&nbsp; \&nbsp;1980) been the most important spawning ground for Bristol Bay red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) because post-larvae are thought to have been most likely to reach optimal settlement habitat along the Alaska Peninsula when hatched from this area as part of an endless-belt reproductive strategy. We coupled a biophysical and oceanographic circulation model to test this hypothesis, investigate larval connectivity of more recent female spatial distributions, and evaluate the importance of climate variability on larval advection trajectories. Predicted settlement success varied through changes in larval pelagic duration and oceanographic circulation patterns: Shorter advective distance was associated with warmer conditions, causing higher rates of local retention relative to cold conditions. Contrary to earlier models, most larvae hatched in southwest Bristol Bay were advected offshore away from good habitat, whereas larvae hatched in central and nearshore Bristol Bay were retained in or advected to good habitat along the Alaska Peninsula. Our results suggest contemporary spatial distributions can supply settlement-competent larvae to nurseries along the Alaska Peninsula and that under certain conditions, larvae may reach the Pribilof Islands when hatched from southwest Bristol Bay. Our study informs the role of environmental variability on larval transport and provides context within which to structure future investigations of recruitment mechanisms.</p>

In France, Mnemiopsis leidyi is present in Mediterranean lagoons and estuaries along La Manche Sea. Mnemiopsis was first recorded in the Berre Lagoon in early 2000. This lagoon has been highly perturbated for years, with a large volume of freshwater inflow through natural rivers and a succession of large hydroelectric power plants, inducing important eutrophication. Legislation has been implemented to improve the health status of the lagoon since 1994. A long-term study was undertaken in 2010 to measure Mnemiopsis population dynamics, and to identify the main drivers of its persistence in this highly anthropogenic lagoon. In 2011 and 2012, during extreme winter conditions, populations of this ctenophore were not observed for months. Its re-appearance later in year could be linked to either a new introduction from the Mediterranean Sea or the existence of retention areas where individuals sought refugia.

The species presents a planktonic larval phase, constituting an interesting subject for dispersal studies, given the larval release in intertidal areas, followed by the exportation to shelf waters where larval development takes place. Onshore migration to the adult habitats is thought to be performed by the megalopa stage. Observations obtained during a summer zooplankton survey showed P. marmoratus larvae gradually farther from the coast throughout larval development, with early larval stages found in surface layers and megalopae occurring closer to the coast. The vertical migration mechanisms for larval dispersal and the return to settlement habitats were tested through physical-ecological models where the vertical distributions changed through the larval development. Ecological data, such as the ontogenetic vertical distribution of each larval stage, larval duration, and time and sites of spawning, were integrated in an oceanic model. Simulations tested different vertical distributions and periods, covering the entire larval development from intertidal areas to shelf and back to shore. The distribution of the early stages in surface layers promoted cross- and alongshore transport. Differences in the initial advection determined the positions where the more advanced stages were found later in the development. The subsurface distribution of advanced stages facilitated the transport to the inner shelf, limiting the cross-shore upwelling transport and promoting higher return to the adult habitats. Different periods of larval release resulted in contrasting dispersal patterns that could influence larval survival and recruitment to adult populations.</p>

Model accumulation maps were validated against sampling at nine beaches, with sediment microplastic concentrations up to 78 particles/kg (dry weight). Hydrodynamic modelling revealed that discharged particle amount is only semi-coupled to beaching rates, which are strongly mouth dependent and occur within the first ten days.

	abstract = {<p>Western boundary currents are characterised by high mesoscale eddy activity including that of cyclonic frontal eddies (CFEs). These form frequently adjacent to the shelf-break, export coastal water and affect biological productivity. Here, we study the physical properties of eddies identified within the intensification zone of the East Australian Current (EAC) through the analysis of remotely sensed data, the application of an ocean circulation model and the evaluation of Lagrangian simulations during austral winter 2007. We examine the spatial and temporal evolution of identified eddies, investigate their formation mechanism, and quantify the contribution made to cross-shelf exchanges. The mesoscale eddies are tracked from generation to decay using an eddy detection and tracking method. In this case study, we identify two CFEs referred to as C1 and C2 with lifetimes of 11 and 38 days and radii of 45 and 70 km, respectively, and one anticyclonic eddy (ACE) with a lifetime of 62 days and a radius of 60 km. Both CFEs interact with the ACE leading to quasi-stationary dipole-eddies located in the vicinity of the shelf. This is the first time dipole-eddies are reported for the intensification zone of the EAC. The location of CFEs characterised by negative sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and clockwise rotation coincides with remotely-sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) anomalies. CFEs C1 and C2 appear to contribute in different ways to the cross-shelf transport along the shelf-break. CFE C1 drives a stronger onshore transport, while CFE C2 appears to enhance the offshore transport. The estimated export of shelf water associated with CFE C2 is estimated with about 1.23 Sv (\&nbsp;106  km3 day\&minus;1). It renews the regional shelf water in about 7 days. The lifetime of CFE C2 is about 38 days, thus the eddy had the potential to flush the shelf at least five times. The CFEs intensify the cross-shelf exchange that is due to the wind-driven cyclonic circulation of the Fraser Gyre. This seasonally occurring gyre dominates the local shelf during austral autumn and winter. The results from this study demonstrate the importance of CFEs in exporting cooler and Chl-a enriched shelf water into the warmer and oligotrophic waters of the southward-flowing EAC.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Deep-sea mining has gained international interest to provide materials for the worldwide industry. European oceans and, particularly, the Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone present a recognized number of areas with polymetallic sulphides rich in metals used in high technology developments. A large part of these resources are in the vicinity of sensitive ecosystems, where the mineral extraction can potentially damage deep-ocean life services. In this context, technological research must be intensified, towards the implementation of environmental friendly solutions that mitigate the associated impacts. To reproduce deep-sea dynamics and evaluate the effects of the mining activities, reliable numerical modelling tools should be developed. The present work highlights the usefulness of a new framework for risk and impact assessment based on oceanographic numerical models to support the adoption of good management practices for deep-sea sustainable exploitation. This tool integrates the oceanic circulation model ROMS-Agrif with the semi-Lagrangian model ICHTHYOP, allowing the representation of deep-sea dynamics and particles trajectories considering the sediments physical properties. Numerical simulations for the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge region, revealed the ability of ROMS-Agrif to simulate real deep-sea dynamics through validation with in situ data. Results showed a strong diversity in the particle residence time, with a dependency on their density and size but also on local ocean conditions and bottom topography. The highest distances are obtained for the smaller and less dense particles, although they tend to be confined by bathymetric constrains and deposited in deepest regions. This work highlights the potential of this modelling tool to forecast laden plume trajectories, allowing the definition of risk assessment scenarios for deep-sea mining activities and the implementation of sustainable exploitation plans. Furthermore, the coupling of this numerical solution with models of biota inhabiting deep-sea vent fields into ecosystem models is discussed and outlined as cost-effective tools for the management of these remote ecosystems.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Abstract The health and functioning of coral reef ecosystems in the Western Indian Ocean are in decline due to anthropogenic stress, and the rate of decline is set to accelerate. Marine reserves have become important tools in mitigating these pressures, and one of the most critical factors in determining their spatial design is the degree of connectivity among populations. However, the spatial scale and strength at which populations are potentially connected by dispersal remain uncertain. In this paper, the potential connectivity of corals was assessed through a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled offline with an ocean circulation numerical model. Connectivity metrics and graph theory were used to analyze the networks and highlight those reefs that are critical for maintaining the connectivity of corals across the region. Western Indian Ocean coral reefs formed about 13 clusters for larvae with short pelagic larval duration (PLD; 5 days) but grouped into stable larger clusters at 15, 30, and 60 days PLDs, with strong westward dispersal from the northern tip of Madagascar and Comoro Islands toward the East African coast. Reefs at Mafia-Latham Island (Tanzania), Angoche-Nacala and Pemba-Mucufi (Mozambique), Anjouan and Ngazidja (Comoros), and Glorieuses (France) were the most significant for multigenerational connectivity, as measured by betweenness centrality. The small islands Agalega and Tromelin were completely disconnected from other sites at all PLDs. These findings identify priority conservation areas and actions to help support coral reef resilience through a connected network of marine protected areas.</p>

	abstract = {<p>The Juan Fern\&aacute;ndez Ridge (JFRE) is a vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) located off the coast of central Chile formed by the Juan Fern\&aacute;ndez Archipelago and a group of seamounts. This ecosystem has unique biological and oceanographic features, characterized by: small geographical units, high degree of endemism with a high degree of connectivity within the system. Two fleets have historically operated in this system: a long term coastal artisanal fishery associated with the Islands, focused mainly on lobster, and a mainland based industrial demersal finfish fishery operating on the seamounts which is currently considered overexploited. The management of these fisheries has been based on a classical single-species approach to determine output controls (industrial fleet) and a mixed management system with formal and informal components (artisanal fleet). There has been growing interest in increasing the exploitation of fisheries, and modernization of the fishing fleet already operating in the JFRE. Under this scenario of increased levels of fishing exploitation and the high level of interrelation of species it might be necessary to understand the impact of these fisheries from a holistic perspective based on a ecosystem-based modeling approach. To address these challenges we developed an Atlantis end-to-end model was configured for this ecosystem. The implemented model has a high degree of skill in representing the observed trends and fluctuations of the JFRE. The model shows that the industrial fishing has a localized impact and the artisanal fisheries have a relatively low impact on the ecosystem, mainly via the lobster fishery. The model indicates that the depletion of large sized lobster has leads to an increase in the population of sea urchins. Although this increase is not sufficient, as yet, to cause substantial flow-on effects to other groups, caution is advised in case extra pressure leads the ecosystem towards a regime shift.</p>

Knowledge of connectivity patterns in marine populations is fundamental for defining population viability and progressing with management and conservation goals. Here, we developed a biophysical, individual-based larval dispersal model to assess the effect of oceanographic variability and biological traits (i.e. larval diel vertical migration [DVM] and temperature-dependent larval development [PLD]) on recruitment success, dispersal distance, and alongshore connectivity patterns. We selected 2 species exploited by Chilean artisanal fisheries: Loxechinus albus (PLD: 20 d) and Fissurella latimarginata (PLD: 5 d). A sensitivity analysis was used to examine the effect of intrinsic (DVM and PLD) and extrinsic (release depth, latitude, and timing) processes. Release location and timing of release explained respectively 24.30 and 5.54\% (F. latimarginata) and 34.8 and 4.19\% (L. albus) of the variability observed in recruitment success, and 23.80 and 6.94\% (F. latimarginata) and 26.10 and 19.60\% (L. albus) of the variability observed in dispersal distance. Most recruitment to local populations was allochthonous, presenting low levels of self-recruitment and local retention, including species with short PLD. Similar geographic patterns of source and destination strengths were observed in both species, showing a geographic mosaic of source and sink populations with relatively higher importance towards the northern region of the study area. Our findings allow us to identify primary determinants of recruitment success and dispersal distance for 2 important exploited species in Chile.</p>

Despite a continuous, intense relocation of seeds from LTI, the natural bank population still persists there. To understand this, we studied larval connectivity between LTI and SB using the first invertebrate larval transport biophysical model developed in the region. Larval local retention were 2.4\% and 1.57\% on average at LTI and SB respectively, while larval transport from SB to LTI was 0.02\% on average and 0.07\% in the opposite direction. Both larval retention and larval transport increased with spawning depth and were highest in austral summer. Two main larval transport paths from SB to LTI were identified, resulting from a combination of horizontal mesoscale circulation patterns and vertical flows.

	abstract = {<p>The total spatial coverage of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within the Brazilian Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) has recently achieved the quantitative requirement of the Aichii Biodiversity Target 11. However, the distribution of MPAs in the Brazilian EEZ is still unbalanced regarding the proportion of protected ecosystems, protection goals and management types. Moreover, the demographic connectivity between these MPAs and their effectiveness regarding the maintenance of biodiversity are still not comprehensively understood. An individual-based modeling scheme coupled with a regional hydrodynamic model of the ocean is used to determine the demographic connectivity of reef fishes based on the widespread genus Sparisoma found in the oceanic islands and on the Brazilian continental shelf between 10\&deg; N and 23\&deg; S. Model results indicate that MPAs are highly isolated due to extremely low demographic connectivity. Consequently, low connectivity and the long distances separating MPAs contribute to their isolation. Therefore, the current MPA design falls short of its goal of maintaining the demographic connectivity of Sparisoma populations living within these areas. In an extreme scenario in which the MPAs rely solely on protected populations for recruits, it is unlikely that they will be able to effectively contribute to the resilience of these populations or other reef fish species sharing the same dispersal abilities. Results also show that recruitment occurs elsewhere along the continental shelf indicating that the protection of areas larger than the current MPAs would enhance the network, maintain connectivity and contribute to the conservation of reef fishes.</p>

Passive larval drift simulations using a dispersal biophysical model showed a large variability in the possible trajectories from spawning to nursery areas and in the predicted ages for larvae arrival on the two nursery sites. The most common ages at arrival obtained in the simulations (20\&ndash;60 days) are broadly consistent with previous modeling studies but contrast with the actual ages of the S. aurata post-larvae collected in 2016 and 2017 at time of the lagoon entrances (60\&ndash;90 days, from otolith readings). The period between 25 and 70 days being critical for gilthead seabream larvae to acquire sufficient swimming, osmoregulatory, and olfactory abilities to enter coastal lagoons, we argue that ontogenic development plays a crucial role in the transport and local retention of S. aurata larvae in the studied region, explaining the discrepancy between simulation results and observed data.</p>

We genotyped newly settled postlarvae in the Florida Keys and adults of spiny lobster from the Florida Keys and throughout the Caribbean Sea. We identified strong larval connectivity between Dominican Republic, Belize, Nicaragua, the Florida Keys, and West-Florida. The larval dispersal modeling suggests that Florida\&rsquo;s lobster population could receive recruits from within and from other areas outside its state and national maritime boundaries. The genetic analyses refine the oceanographic model indicating that the connectivity patterns described could also result from unknown parental populations sourcing adults and postlarvae in different spawning seasons to the Florida Keys. We discuss the importance of small temporal scales to identify patterns in larval export. Our findings are significant on two levels. From the larval dispersal perspective, genetic results and biophysical modeling identify patterns of gene flow enhancing persistence of local populations. From an economic and fishery perspective, P. argus is the most important commercial species in the Caribbean and our results inform how considering larval source and sink dynamics across international boundaries could improve management plans at local, national, and regional levels.</p>

Vertical distribution of commercially important lobster Nephrops norvegicus larvae was examined over fishing grounds off the west and east coasts of Ireland. Larval vertical distribution for both grounds was significantly influenced by the temperature differential between the surface and 60 m depth, zooplankton biomass and, to a lesser extent, stratification, measured using the potential energy anomaly. Fixed station sampling was conducted over 3 d in the western Irish Sea (WIS) to investigate the occurrence and extent of a diel vertical migration (DVM). Larvae performed twilight DVM with an ~10 m ascent prior to sunset and sunrise and a descent at midnight and after sunrise. Particle-tracking model simulations were used to examine the effect of DVM behaviour on larval retention over mud habitat. The presence of a DVM actually reduced the likelihood of retention on both the Aran and WIS grounds. Predicted larval retention was unusually low over the Aran grounds in 2018, which is potentially significant in the context of historic stock fluctuations in this area. These findings suggest that understanding larval dynamics could be crucial in managing N. norvegicus stocks on fishing grounds, in particular those with variable interannual oceanography and a low rate of larval donation from other grounds.</p>

In this study we couple physiologically grounded mechanistic models with biogeographic surveys in 2 years with high levels of annual temperature variation to disentangle the drivers of a historical range shift driven by climate change. The distribution of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides has shifted 350 km poleward in the past half century along the east coast of the United States. Recruits were present throughout the historical range following the 2015 reproductive season, when temperatures were similar to those in the past century, and absent following the 2016 reproductive season when temperatures were warmer than they have been since 1870, the earliest date for temperature records. Our dispersal dependent mechanistic models of reproductive success were highly accurate and predicted patterns of reproduction success documented in field surveys throughout the historical range in 2015 and 2016. Our mechanistic models of reproductive success not only predicted recruitment dynamics near the range edge but also predicted interior range fragmentation in a number of years between 1870 and 2016. All recruits monitored within the historical range following the 2015 colonization died before 2016 suggesting juvenile survival was likely the primary driver of the historical range retraction. However, if 2016 is indicative of future temperatures mechanisms of range limitation will shift and reproductive failure will lead to further range retraction in the future. Mechanistic models are necessary for accurately predicting the effects of climate change on ranges of species.</p>

In the North West Gulf of Mexico (NW GOM), the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) is an isolated reef ecosystem comprising contiguous shallow and mesophotic reefs habitats on two central banks along the margin of the continental shelf. A future expansion of the sanctuary is proposed to include additional mesophotic banks and aims at building a network of protected areas in the NW GOM to ensure the persistence of the coral reef populations inhabiting the sanctuary. To evaluate the feasibility of this expansion and investigate the overall dynamics of coral species in the region, we studied the patterns of larval connectivity of Montastraea cavernosa, a common depth generalist coral species, using a larval dispersal modelling approach. Our results highlighted larval exports from the NW GOM banks to the northeastern and southwestern GOM larval connectivity between all banks investigated in this study, and the potential for exporting larvae from mesophotic to shallower reefs. Our study associated with Studivan and Voss (2018; associate manuscript) demonstrates the relevance of combining modeling and genetic methods to consider both demographic and genetic timescales for the evaluation of the connectivity dynamics of marine populations. In the case of the NW GOM, both studies support the future management plan for expanding FGBNMS.</p>

Here, we link prioritization methods with population models to explore the impact of integrating both representation and connectivity into conservation planning for species persistence. Using data on 288 Mediterranean fish species with varying conservation requirements, we show that: (1) considering both representation and connectivity objectives provides the best strategy for enhanced biodiversity persistence and (2) connectivity objectives were fundamental to enhancing persistence of small-ranged species, which are most in need of conservation, while the representation objective benefited only wide-ranging species. Our approach provides a more comprehensive appraisal of planning applications than approaches focusing on either representation or connectivity, and will hopefully contribute to build more effective reserve networks for the persistence of biodiversity.</p>

Management relies on regular monitoring, but there is a lack of robust theories for the emergence of the populations\&rsquo; traits and their evolution in highly variable environments. This work aims to address existing knowledge gaps by combining physical and biogeochemical modelling with an individual life-cycle based model applied to round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) off northwest Africa, a key species for regional food security. Our approach focused on the processes responsible for seasonal migrations, spatio-temporal size-structure, and interannual biomass fluctuations. Emergence of preferred habitat resulted from interactions between natal homing behavior and environmental variability that impacts early life stages. Exploration of the environment by the fishes was determined by swimming capabilities, mesoscale to regional habitat structure, and horizontal currents. Fish spatio-temporal abundance variability emerged from a complex combination of distinct life-history traits. An alongshore gradient in fish size distributions is reported and validated by in situ measurements. New insights into population structure are provided, within an area where the species is abundant year-round (Mauritania) and with latitudinal migrations of variable (300\&ndash;1200 km) amplitude. Interannual biomass fluctuations were linked to modulations of fish recruitment over the Sahara Bank driven by variability in alongshore current intensity. The identified processes constitute an analytical framework that can be implemented in other EBUS and used to explore impacts of regional climate change on SPF.</p>

Here we use regional ocean circulation models to estimate dispersal of the intertidal barnacle Semibalanus balanoides at its local distribution limit in Southwest England. We incorporate historical and recent repatriation events to provide support for our modeled dispersal estimates, which predict a recolonization rate similar to that observed in two recolonization events. Using graph theory techniques to describe the dispersal landscape, we identify likely physical barriers to dispersal in the region.

	abstract = {<p>Abstract Sea turtle strandings provide important mortality information, yet knowledge of turtle carcass at-sea drift and decomposition characteristics are needed to better understand and manage where these mortalities occur. We used empirical sea turtle carcass decomposition and drift experiments in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, \{USA\} to estimate probable carcass oceanic drift times and quantify the impact of direct wind forcing on carcass drift. Based on the time period during which free-floating turtle carcasses tethered nearshore were buoyant, we determined that oceanic drift duration of turtle carcasses was highly dependent on water temperature and varied from 2 to 15 days during typical late spring to early fall Bay water conditions. The importance of direct wind forcing for turtle carcass drift was assessed based on track divergence rates from multiple simultaneous deployments of three types of surface drifters: bucket drifters, artificial turtles and turtle carcass drifters. Turtle drift along-wind leeway was found to vary from 1 to 4\% of wind speed, representing an added drift velocity of approximately 0.030.2 m/s), suggesting wind is important for carcass drift. Estimated carcass drift parameters were integrated into a Chesapeake Bay oceanographic drift model to predict carcass drift to terrestrial stranding locations. Increased drift duration (e.g., due to low temperatures) increases mean distance between expected mortality events and stranding locations, as well as decreases overall likelihood of retention in the Bay. Probable mortality hotspots for the peak month of strandings (June) were identified off coastal southeastern Virginia and within the lower Bay, including the Bay mouth and lower James River. Overall, results support that sea turtle drift time is quite variable, and varies greatly depending on water and air temperature as well as oceanic conditions. Knowledge of these parameters will improve our ability to interpret stranding events around the globe.</p>

	abstract = {<p>There are many marine protected areas (MPAs) containing coral reef aggregations in the eastern Pacific region. However, the connectivity of corals between MPAs is still poorly known, especially in the Marine Conservation Corridor of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (MCCETP). Here, we assess the potential connectivity of corals across equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs through a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled offline with an ocean-circulation numerical model. Connectivity metrics and graph theory were used to analyze the networks and highlight those MPAs that are critical for maintaining the connectivity of corals across the region. Our results show that the equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs form a relatively well-connected network, at least 40\% of coral larvae released per year end up within the boundaries of an MPA. MPAs like Malpelo and Gorgona islands included in the MCCETP were found to be critical for connectivity of corals because of their high betweenness centrality and potential role as stepping-stones between coastal MPAs and offshore MPAs such as the Galapagos Islands. Two pelagic larval duration (PLD) scenarios (40 and 130 days) indicate a quasi-unidirectional larval flow from coastal MPAs toward oceanic MPAs, where the only resilient MPAs (Coiba and Malpelo islands) depend mostly on subsidiary recruitment from MPAs located along the coast of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. In the two PLD scenarios, Cocos Island maintains a very low resilience potential. Our results indicate the imperative need to include coastal MPAs in the MCCETP network initiative, since connectivity and resilience of coral reefs in the equatorial eastern Pacific region rely heavily on coastal MPAs.</p>

	abstract = {<p>The Juan Fern\&aacute;ndez Ridge (JFR) is a chain of topographical elevations in the eastern South Pacific (\&sim;33\&ndash;35\&deg;S, 76\&ndash;81.5\&deg;W). Rich in endemic marine species, this ridge is frequently affected by the arrival of mesoscale eddies originating in the coastal upwelling zone off central-southern Chile. The impacts of these interactions on the structure and dynamics of the JFR pelagic system have, however, not been addressed yet. The present model-based study is focused on the coupled influence of mesoscale-submesoscale processes and biological behavior (i.e., diel vertical migration) on the horizontal distribution of planktonic larvae of the spiny lobster (Jasus frontalis) around the JFR waters. Two case studies were selected from a hydrodynamic Regional Ocean Modeling System to characterize mesoscale and submesoscale structures and an Individual-based model (IBM) to simulate diel vertical migration (DVM) and its impact on the horizontal distribution and the patchiness level. DVM behavior of these larvae has not been clearly characterized, therefore, three types of vertical mechanisms were assessed on the IBM: (1) no migration (LG), (2) a short migration (0\&ndash;50 m depth, DVM1), and (3) a long migration (10\&ndash;200 m depth, DVM2). The influence of physical properties (eddy kinetic energy, stretching deformation and divergence) on larval aggregation within meso and submesoscale features was quantified. The patchiness index assessed for mesoscale and submesoscale structures showed higher values in the mesoscale than in the submesoscale. However, submesoscale structures revealed a higher accumulation of particles by unit of area. Both vertical migration mechanisms produced larger patchiness indices compared to the no migration experiment. DVM2 was the one that showed by far the largest aggregation of almost all the aggregation zones. Larval concentrations were highest in the submesoscale structures; these zones were characterized by low eddy kinetic energy, negative stretching deformation, and slight convergence. Stretching deformation flow appeared to be triggered by the eddy-eddy interactions and the Robinson Island barrier effect, and it likely promotes the aggregation of the spiny lobster larvae in the Juan Fern\&aacute;ndez system. These results highlighted the importance of the coupled effect of physical (mesoscale and submesoscale oceanographic features) and biological processes (DVM) in the generation of larval patchiness and concentration of spiny lobster larvae around the JFR, which could be key for their survival and retention in those waters.</p>

	journal = {Progress in Oceanography},
	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>Several empirical plankton studies and realistic numerical models of the coastal ocean have clearly shown the dramatic effects that larval behaviour and coastal topography can have on effective alongshore dispersal, population connectivity, successful recruitment and cross-shore distribution of the larval stages of benthic coastal invertebrates and fish. All these are essentially distinct and ecologically important aspects of the dispersal process, but which are correlated to a greater or lesser extent through the interaction of larval attributes (e.g. behaviour, pelagic larval duration, PLD) and specific velocity fields of a region of the ocean. Vertical positioning in the water column and ontogenetic and diel vertical migration (DVM) have been identified as the most efficient behavioural mechanisms that can modulate larval transport in the ocean, especially in stratified, baroclinic water columns such as those typically found in upwelling ecosystems. The large seasonal variability in circulation within most upwelling ecosystems is therefore expected to deeply influence all aspects of the larval dispersal process, but it has been less researched. Here we use a realistic representation of velocity fields across a section of the Humboldt Current Upwelling Ecosystem (HCUE) to evaluate the relative effects of variation in PLD, geographic position, DVM and the timing of larval release on successful onshore recruitment, alongshore dispersal distances, cross-shore retention and persistence of recruitment spatial patterns. Our results show that an increase in pelagic larval duration exponentially increase larval waste, consequently reducing onshore recruitment, regardless of whether larvae perform DVM or not during their development. For any given larval duration, season of the year and location along the shore (topography) had the largest effects on recruitment variability, explaining over 8.49\% and over 11.47\% of the temporal and spatial variation, respectively. In contrast, while DVM had a highly consistent positive effect on recruitment along the shore, PLD\&rsquo;s and seasons, it only explained about 3\% of recruitment variability. Thus, while performing DVM appears to be a safe strategy to increase recruitment, selective forces for such behaviour maybe weak when only oceanic transport is considered. Neither season of the year, nor larval behaviour altered the broad spatial pattern of recruitment across the study region. Pelagic larval durations of over 20 days did not significantly alter this spatial pattern either, suggesting the existence of persistent sources and sinks for benthic populations across the region, although the connectivity matrices must be examined in more detail. Interestingly, in the section of the HCUE, the DVM behaviour led to significantly higher mean dispersal distances along the shore during the upwelling season, as compared to passively advected particles. Such a behavioural effect on dispersal distances have all but disappeared when larvae were released in winter time. These results demonstrate that onshore recruitment, dispersal and connectivity among populations are not correlated across the different larval behaviours, as it has often been implied in the literature and that timing of peak larval release must receive more attention within the HCUE. Results also illustrate the importance of examining fundamental questions of the dispersal process, distance, recruitment, retention, connectivity, in different regions of the world\&rsquo;s costal ocean.</p>

A general sea turtle carcass oceanographic drift model was developed to estimate likely mortality locations from coastal sea turtle stranding records. Key model advancements include realistic direct wind forcing on carcasses, temperature driven carcass decomposition and the development of mortality location predictions for individual strandings. We applied this model to 2009\&ndash;2014 stranding events within the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia. Predicted origin of vessel strike strandings were compared to commercial vessel data, and potential hazardous turtle-vessel interactions were identified in the southeastern Bay and James River. Commercial fishing activity of gear types with known sea turtle interactions were compared to predicted mortality locations for stranded turtles with suggested fisheries-induced mortality. Probable mortality locations for these strandings varied seasonally, with two distinct areas in the southwest and southeast portions of the lower Bay. Spatial overlap was noted between potential mortality locations and gillnet, seine, pot, and pound net fisheries, providing important information for focusing future research on mitigating conflict between sea turtles and human activities. Our ability to quantitatively assess spatial and temporal overlap between sea turtle mortality and human uses of the habitat were hindered by the low resolution of human use datasets, especially those for recreational vessel and commercial fishing gear distributions. This study highlights the importance of addressing these data gaps and provides a meaningful conservation tool that can be applied to stranding data of sea turtles and other marine megafauna worldwide.</p>

Following the 2012 north Adriatic Sea cold outbreak, DW masses were intercepted at ca. 460\&thinsp;km south the area of origin and compared to resident ones in term of plankton biomass partitioning (pico to micro size) and phytoplankton species composition. Results indicated a relatively higher contribution of heterotrophs in DW than in deep resident water masses, probably as result of DW-mediated advection of fresh organic matter available to consumers. DWs showed unusual high abundances of Skeletonema sp., a diatom that bloomed in the north Adriatic during DW formation. The Lagrangian numerical model set up on this diatom confirmed that DW flow could be an important mechanism for plankton/particles export to deep waters. We conclude that the predicted climate-induced variability in DW formation events could have the potential to affect the ecosystem functioning of the deeper part of the Mediterranean basin, even at significant distance from generation sites.</p>

Lying at the heart of island biogeography theory, LDD relies on unusual events to facilitate colonization of new habitats and range expansion. Despite the importance of LDD, it is inherently difficult to quantify due to the rarity of such events. We estimate the probability of LDD of the seagrass Heterozostera nigricaulis, a common Australian species, across the Pacific Ocean to colonize South America. Location Coastal Chile, Australia and the Pacific Ocean. Methods Genetic analyses of H.\&nbsp;nigricaulis collected from Chile and Australia were used to assess the relationship between the populations and levels of clonality. Ocean surface current models were used to predict the probability of propagules dispersing from south-east Australia to central Chile and shipping data used to determine the likelihood of anthropogenic dispersal. Results Our study infers that the seagrass H.\&nbsp;nigricaulis dispersed from Australia across the entire width of the Pacific (c.\&nbsp;14,000 km) to colonize South America on two occasions. Genetic analyses reveal that these events led to two large isolated clones, one of which covers a combined area of 3.47 km2. Oceanographic models estimate the arrival probability of a dispersal propagule within 3 years to be at most 0.00264\%. Early shipping provides a potential alternative dispersal vector, yet few ships sailed from SE Australia to Chile prior to the first recording of H.\&nbsp;nigricaulis and the lack of more recent and ongoing introductions demonstrate the rarity of such dispersal. Main conclusions These findings demonstrate LDD does occur over extreme distances despite very low probabilities. The large number of propagules (100s of millions) produced over 100s of years suggests that the arrival of propagules in Chile was inevitable and confirms the importance of LDD for species distributions and community ecology.</p>

	abstract = {<p>The European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) is the most important small pelagic fishery of the Western Iberia Upwelling Ecosystem (WIUE). Recently, recruitment of this species has declined due to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, controversies exist regarding its population structure with barriers thought to exist between the Atlantic-Iberian Peninsula, Northern Africa, and the Mediterranean. Few studies have investigated the transport and dispersal of sardine eggs and larvae off Iberia and the subsequent impact on larval recruitment variability. Here, we examine these issues using a Regional Ocean Modeling System climatology (1989\&ndash;2008) coupled to the Lagrangian transport model, Ichthyop. Using biological parameters from the literature, we conduct simulations that investigate the effects of spawning patchiness, diel vertical migration behaviors, and egg buoyancy on the transport and recruitment of virtual sardine ichthyoplankton on the continental shelf. We find that release area, release depth, and month of release all significantly affect recruitment. Patchiness has no effect and diel vertical migration causes slightly lower recruitment. Egg buoyancy effects are significant and act similarly to depth of release. As with other studies, we find that recruitment peaks vary by latitude, explained here by the seasonal variability of offshore transport. We find weak, continuous alongshore transport between release areas, though a large proportion of simulated ichthyoplankton transport north to the Cantabrian coast (up to 27\%). We also show low level transport into Morocco (up to 1\%) and the Mediterranean (up to 8\%). The high proportion of local retention and low but consistent alongshore transport supports the idea of a series of metapopulations along this coast.</p>

	pages = {27 - 38},
	abstract = {<p>The dynamics and seasonal variability of jet currents on the southern Benguela shelf-edge are investigated using a climatologically forced Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) model. The jet is primarily forced by the intense horizontal gradients that exist across the southern Benguela shelf. These gradients are set up by nearshore cooling via the strongly seasonal upwelling regime and variable offshore warming by the advection of Agulhas waters. While the nearshore cooling is prevalent only during the spring and summer upwelling season, the offshore warming exists throughout the year. As a result intensified geostrophically adjusted currents exist throughout the year, particularly off the Cape Peninsula and Cape Columbine. However, the distinct shelf-edge jet features are most intense during upwelling seasons and extend, more or less continuously, from Cape Agulhas, the southern-tip of the continent, to Cape Columbine. The spring and summer jet off the Cape Peninsula reaches speeds of at least 0.7m.s\&minus;1, bifurcates as it moves northward. The branch that continues northward over the shelf goes on to feed the offshore branch of the Cape Columbine jet (over the 500m isobath) and to a less extent the nearshore branch (over the 200m isobath) that is locally enhanced by upwelling processes. During winter, the Cape Peninsula jet is more confined to the shelf region and goes on to feed the whole outer-shelf (200\&ndash;500m) region off and beyond Cape Columbine. An ageostrophic component associated with offshore non-linearities related to Agulhas influx causes the mean manifestation of the Cape Peninsula jet to broaden slightly (60km) compared to its 40km-wide geostrophic core which is situated over the 350m isobath. The ageostrophic component is related to the generation of eddies that cause the isopycnals to flatten out.</p>

	pages = {205 - 214},
	abstract = {<p>Since 2011, beach inundation of massive amounts of pelagic Sargassum algae has occurred around the Caribbean nations and islands. Previous studies have applied satellite ocean color to determine the origins of this phenomenon. These techniques, combined with complementary approaches, suggest that, rather than blooms originating in the Caribbean, they arrive from the Equatorial Atlantic. However, oceanographic context for these occurrences remains limited. Here, we present results from synthetic particle tracking experiments that characterize the interannual and seasonal dynamics of ocean currents and winds likely to influence the transport of Sargassum from the Equatorial Atlantic into the Caribbean Sea. Our findings suggest that Sargassum present in the western Equatorial Atlantic (west of longitude 50\&deg;W) has a high probability of entering the Caribbean Sea within a year\&rsquo;s time. Transport routes include the Guiana Current, North Brazil Current Rings, and the North Equatorial Current north of the North Brazil Current Retroflection. The amount of Sargassum following each route varies seasonally. This has important implications for the amount of time it takes Sargassum to reach the Caribbean Sea. By weighting particle transport predictions with Sargassum concentrations at release sites in the western Equatorial Atlantic, our simulations explain close to 90\% of the annual variation in observed Sargassum abundance entering the Caribbean Sea. Additionally, results from our numerical experiments are in good agreement with observations of variability in the timing of Sargassum movement from the Equatorial Atlantic to the Caribbean, and observations of the spatial extent of Sargassum occurrence throughout the Caribbean. However, this work also highlights some areas of uncertainty that should be examined, in particular the effect of \&ldquo;windage\&rdquo; and other surface transport processes on the movement of Sargassum. Our results provide a useful launching point to predict Sargassum beaching events along the Caribbean islands well in advance of their occurrence and, more generally, to understand the movement ecology of a floating ecosystem that is essential habitat to numerous marine species.</p>

This is especially challenging in the case of coastal fish, for which information on egg release zones (i.e. spawning grounds) is often lacking. Here we assessed the putative location of egg release zones of the saddled sea bream (Oblada melanura) along the south-eastern coast of Spain in 2013. To this aim, we hindcasted propagule (egg and larva) dispersal using Lagrangian simulations, fed with species-specific information on early life history traits (ELTs), with two approaches: 1) back-tracking and 2) comparing settler distribution obtained from simulations to the analogous distribution resulting from otolith chemical analysis. Simulations were also used to assess which factors contributed the most to dispersal distances. Back-tracking simulations indicated that both the northern sector of the Murcia region and some traits of the North-African coast were hydrodynamically suitable to generate and drive the supply of larvae recorded along the coast of Murcia in 2013. With the second approach, based on the correlation between simulation outputs and field results (otolith chemical analysis), we found that the oceanographic characteristics of the study area could have determined the pattern of settler distribution recorded with otolith analysis in 2013 and inferred the geographical position of main O. melanura spawning grounds along the coast. Dispersal distance was found to be significantly affected by the geographical position of propagule release zones. The combination of methods used was the first attempt to assess the geographical position of propagule release zones in the Mediterranean Sea for O. melanura, and can represent a valuable approach for elucidating dispersal and connectivity patterns in other coastal species.</p>

The development of offshore wind farms in the area would provide hard substrata for the settlement of sessile benthos. Since the seafloor of the Adriatic is predominantly sedimentary this may alter the larval connectivity of benthic populations in the region. Here, we simulated the release of larvae from benthic populations along the coasts of the Adriatic Sea using coupled bio-physical models and investigated the effect of pelagic larval duration on dispersal. Our model simulations show that currents typically carry particles from east to west across the Adriatic, whereas particles released along western coasts tend to remain there with the Puglia coast of Italy acting as a sink for larvae from benthic populations. We identify areas of high connectivity, as well as areas that are much more isolated, and discuss how these results can be used to inform marine spatial planning and the licensing of offshore marine renewable energy developments.</p>

	abstract = {<p>S. aurita is the most abundant small pelagic fish in the northern Gulf of Guinea. Its reproduction and recruitment depend crucially on environmental conditions. We developed a biophysical model of S. aurita early life history by coupling offline an individual-based model with the regional oceanic modeling system (ROMS). We used this model to investigate the main factors driving variability in eggs and larval dispersal and survival in the northern Gulf of Guinea. Precisely, individuals were released from different spawning areas along the coast and tracked for a period of 28 days corresponding to their planktonic phase. Individuals that remained in the coastal recruitment areas at an age more than 7 days, at which they can supposedly actively retain themselves in a favorable area, were considered as recruited. Simulation results show the importance of the spawning areas around Cape Palmas and Cape Three Points where cyclonic eddies trap eggs and larvae along the coast, preventing their advection offshore by the Guinea Current. The spawning period also plays a key role in the recruitment success, with highest coastal retention obtained during the major upwelling period (July\&ndash;September). We find that a second retention peak can occur during the minor upwelling period (February\&ndash;March) when larval mortality due to temperature is included in the model. These results are in general agreement with knowledge of S. aurita reproduction in the northern Gulf of Guinea.</p>

To investigate pan-Atlantic connectivity of globally endangered green turtles Chelonia mydas from two National Parks in Florida, USA, we applied a multidisciplinary approach comparing genetic analysis and ocean circulation modeling. The Everglades (EP) is a juvenile feeding ground, whereas the Dry Tortugas (DT) is used for courtship, breeding, and feeding by adults and juveniles. We sequenced two mitochondrial segments from 138 turtles sampled there from 2006\&ndash;2015, and simulated oceanic transport to estimate their origins. Genetic and ocean connectivity data revealed northwestern Atlantic rookeries as the major natal sources, while southern and eastern Atlantic contributions were negligible. However, specific rookery estimates differed between genetic and ocean transport models. The combined analyses suggest that post-hatchling drift via ocean currents poorly explains the distribution of neritic juveniles and adults, but juvenile natal homing and population history likely play important roles. DT and EP were genetically similar to feeding grounds along the southern US coast, but highly differentiated from most other Atlantic groups. Despite expanded mitogenomic analysis and correspondingly increased ability to detect genetic variation, no significant differentiation between DT and EP, or among years, sexes or stages was observed. This first genetic analysis of a North Atlantic green turtle courtship area provides rare data supporting local movements and male philopatry. The study highlights the applications of multidisciplinary approaches for ecological research and conservation.</p>

An ocean model (ROMS) and an individual based model (Ichthyop) were used to assess the relationship between oceanic conditions during the spawning season and commercial landings of the Brazilian sardine one year later. Model output was compared with remote sensing and analysis data showing good consistency. Simulations indicate that mortality of eggs and larvae by low temperature prior to maximum and minimum landings are significantly higher than mortality caused by offshore advection. However, when periods of maximum and minimum sardine landings are compared with respect to these causes of mortality no significant differences were detected. Results indicate that mortality caused by prevailing oceanic conditions at early life stages alone can not be invoked to explain the observed extreme commercial landings of the Brazilian sardine. Likely influencing factors include starvation and predation interacting with the strategy of spawning \&ldquo;at the right place and at the right time\&rdquo;.</p>

This seamount region is \&sim;3500\&thinsp;km from the coastal historic jack mackerel nursery grounds off Chile (north of 30\&deg;S). We reviewed historic evidence of juveniles around this seamount and data on several local environmental conditions: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, wind, turbulence levels, and Eddy kinetic energy (EKE). A Lagrangian model for the early life stages of jack mackerel in the eastern South Pacific was used to assess the potential of the seamount region as a permanent nursery ground. Transport/retention mechanisms were assessed by releasing virtual particles coupled to a growth model into the flow simulated by an eddy-resolving ocean model. Model simulations showed high inter-annual variability for particle retention in the seamount region; high retention levels were associated with low EKE such that the particles were retained for several months. Satellite altimetry has shown a local minimum in eddy activity in the region where the juveniles were observed; this minimum was consistent with the above temporal relationship. The inclusion of the CHAEPR oceanic seamount region as a potential nursery ground for jack mackerel expands the current conceptual framework for the spatial population structure of this species in the South Pacific off central Chile proposed by Arcos et al.

	abstract = {<p>In the South Atlantic Ocean, few data exist regarding the dispersal of young oceanic sea turtles. We characterized the movements of laboratory-reared yearling loggerhead turtles from Brazilian rookeries using novel telemetry techniques, testing for differences in dispersal during different periods of the sea turtle hatching season that correspond to seasonal changes in ocean currents. Oceanographic drifters deployed alongside satellite-tagged turtles allowed us to explore the mechanisms of dispersal (passive drift or active swimming). Early in the hatching season turtles transited south with strong southward currents. Late in the hatching season, when currents flowed in the opposite direction, turtles uniformly moved northwards across the Equator. However, the movement of individuals differed from what was predicted by surface currents alone. Swimming velocity inferred from track data and an ocean circulation model strongly suggest that turtles\&rsquo; swimming plays a role in maintaining their position within frontal zones seaward of the continental shelf. The long nesting season of adults and behaviour of post-hatchlings exposes young turtles to seasonally varying ocean conditions that lead some individuals further into the South Atlantic and others into the Northern Hemisphere. Such migratory route diversity may ultimately buffer the population against environmental changes or anthropologic threats, fostering population resiliency.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Abstract The concentration and spatial distribution of microplastics in the Bay of Brest (Brittany, France) was investigated in two surveys. Surface water and sediment were sampled at nine locations in areas characterized by contrasting anthropic pressures, riverine influences or water mixing. Microplastics were categorized by their polymer type and size class. Microplastic contamination in surface water and sediment was dominated by polyethylene fragments (PE, 53\&ndash;67\%) followed by polypropylene (PP, 16\&ndash;30\%) and polystyrene (PS, 16\&ndash;17\%) microparticles. The presence of buoyant microplastics (PE, \{PP\} and PS) in sediment suggests the existence of physical and/or biological processes leading to vertical transfer of lightweight microplastics in the bay. In sediment (upper 5\&nbsp;cm), the percentage of particles identified by Raman micro-spectroscopy was lower (41\%) than in surface water (79\%) and may explain the apparent low concentration observed in this matrix (0.97\&nbsp;\&plusmn;\&nbsp;2.08\&nbsp;MP\&nbsp;kg\&minus;1 dry sediment). Mean microplastic concentration was 0.24\&nbsp;\&plusmn;\&nbsp;0.35\&nbsp;MP\&nbsp;m\&minus;3 in surface water. We suggest that the observed spatial \{MP\} distribution is related to proximity to urbanized areas and to hydrodynamics in the bay. A particle dispersal model was used to study the influence of hydrodynamics on surface microplastic distribution. The outputs of the model showed the presence of a transitional convergence zone in the centre of the bay during flood tide, where floating debris coming from the northern and southern parts of the bay tends to accumulate before being expelled from the bay. Further modelling work and observations integrating (i) the complex vertical motion of microplastics, and (ii) their point sources is required to better understand the fate of microplastics in such a complex coastal ecosystem.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Summary Migration allows animals to track the environmental conditions that maximize growth, survival, and reproduction [1\&ndash;3]. Improved understanding of the\&nbsp;mechanisms underlying migrations allows for improved management of species and ecosystems [1\&ndash;4]. For centuries, the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) has provided one of Europe\&rsquo;s most important fisheries and has sparked considerable scientific inquiry, most recently owing to the dramatic collapse of juvenile recruitment [5]. Larval eels are transported by ocean currents associated with the Gulf Stream System from Sargasso Sea breeding grounds to coastal and freshwater habitats from North Africa to Scandinavia [6, 7]. After a decade or more, maturing adults migrate back to the Sargasso Sea, spawn, and die [8]. However, the migratory mechanisms that bring juvenile eels to Europe and return adults to the Sargasso Sea remain equivocal [9, 10]. Here, we used a \&ldquo;magnetic displacement\&rdquo; experiment [11, 12] to show that the\&nbsp;orientation of juvenile eels varies in response to subtle differences in magnetic field intensity and inclination angle along their marine migration route. Simulations using an ocean circulation model revealed that even weakly swimming in the experimentally observed directions at the locations corresponding to the magnetic displacements would increase entrainment of juvenile eels into the Gulf Stream System. These findings provide new insight into the migration ecology and recruitment dynamics of eels and suggest that an adaptive magnetic map, tuned to large-scale features of ocean circulation, facilitates the vast oceanic migrations of the Anguilla genus [7, 13, 14].</p>

	abstract = {<p>Variability in the availability of suitable prey (mainly nauplii stages of Calanus spp.) in the early life stages of cod is likely a significant contributor to the fluctuations in the year-class strength in the Arcto Norwegian cod stock. We have investigated the origin of the Lofoten shelf population of Calanus using a particle tracking model approach based on velocity fields simulated from 2002 to 2012. By performing backwards simulations of trajectories from particles released on the Lofoten shelf in early spring, we assessed the relative contribution of potential Calanus sources, such as the Lofoten Basin, the local overwintering on the continental shelf and the adjacent fjords. This analysis revealed significant interannual differences in advection patterns mainly driven by changes in wind conditions and variable strength of the Norwegian Coastal Current. Most of the particles advected into our study area originated on the shelf, and contrary to expectations, only a few originated from the Lofoten Basin where Calanus abundances tend to be high. These results suggest that contribution from the Lofoten Basin to the early spring shelf Calanus population may be overestimated and that contribution from more local sources, especially from adjacent fjords, may play a more important role than what has been previously anticipated. Our results highlight the necessity to improve quantification of shelf-fjord exchange processes, as these may contribute more to the regulation of spring zooplankton stocks on the northern Norwegian shelf, and, as a result, may affect the survival of cod larvae in this area.</p>

	abstract = {<p>The connectivity and three-dimensional (3D) dispersion of the larvae of giant red shrimp, potentially released from known spawning areas along the Sardinia slope in the western Mediterranean Sea, were assessed using Lagrangian simulations forced by a 3D submesoscale permitting a regional ocean model. Biophysical simulations using the hydrodynamic conditions of the year 2012 were run to track propagules released from known spawning areas during the spawning period (May to September). Passive transport (PT) and vertical migration (VM) scenarios were tested, each with two possible pelagic larval durations (PLDs) of 21 or 42\&nbsp;days. Dispersion of propagules in the PT and VM scenarios differed in terms of travelled distance, export out of the domain (larger for VM), and depth distribution (shallower and bimodal for VM due to the larger variability of encountered currents). Connectivity patterns were investigated among eight release areas, and four predetermined Eco-Regions, and results showed strong connectivity among the North-Western (NW), Western (W), and Southern (S) regions of Sardinia, whereas the Eastern region was more segregated. Differences in connectivity patterns among scenarios were related mainly to the tendency of greater retention of propagules in the release area for the PT scenarios. This finding, together with existing hypotheses of vertical migration likely occurring during first egg-larval phases, suggest that the VM scenarios are the most probable of the two hypotheses tested. Strong connectivity between the W and S sides of Sardinia and the relative isolation of the E side could have significant implications for the protection of this important resource.</p>

A three-dimensional particle tracking model coupled to Regional Ocean Modelling System model was used to investigate variability of sole larvae dispersal along the western Iberian coast over a five-year period (2004\&ndash;2009). A sensitivity analysis evaluating: (1) the importance of diel vertical migrations of larvae and (2) the size of designated recruitment areas was performed. Results suggested that connectivity patterns of sole larvae dispersal and their spatio-temporal variability are influenced by the configuration of the coast with its topographical structures and thus the suitable recruitment area available as well as the wind-driven mesoscale circulation along the Iberian coast.</p>

According to our study, the platforms enhance connectivity between subpopulations of jellyfish polyps, help sustain existing shore-based subpopulations, contribute to jellyfish blooms in some areas, and play an important role in establishing connection with the rest of the Mediterranean, in addition to representing substantial amounts of available substrate. This is an aspect that is usually overlooked when evaluating the ecological impact of existing and future wind farms, oil and gas platforms, etc. Our approach could serve as a role model in future studies of ecological impacts of planned offshore constructions.</p>

In August 1999, during the FAX99 cruise, the waters downstream of the Canary Island archipelago displayed intense mesoscale activity, with numerous cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies as well as upwelling filaments. Our results illustrate a close relationship between these mesoscale oceanographic structures and the distribution of decapod larvae, using both field observations and Lagrangian transport modelling. Analysis of plankton samples shows that larvae of pelagic species were excluded from filament waters, whereas larvae of neritic species were heterogeneously distributed, suggesting that the C-ACTZ is a mixing area where larvae originating from both the Canary Islands and the African coast may be present at the same time. This finding was supported by the simulations, which suggested that the larvae collected in the offshore waters south of Gran Canaria came mainly from the African population (between Cape Bojador and Cape Juby) during early August, whereas during the second half of August the targeted area was dominated by larvae released from Fuerteventura populations. Our observations introduce new insights into our understanding of marine population connectivity, the dispersal pathways of the terrestrial biota, and general biogeography in the region.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Sea turtles found stranded on beaches are often rehabilitated before being released back into the wild. The location and date of release is largely selected on an informal basis, which may not maximise the chance of survival. As oceanic conditions have a large influence on the movements of neonate sea turtles, this study aimed to identify the best locations and months to release rehabilitated sea turtles that would assist in their transport by ocean currents to the habitat and thermal conditions required for their survival. A particle tracking model, forced by ocean surface velocity fields were used to simulate the dispersal pathways of millions of passively drifting particles released from different locations in Western Australia. The particles represented rehabilitated, neonate turtles requiring oceanic habitats (green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and loggerheads (Caretta caretta)) and flatback turtles (Natator depressus) which require neritic habitats. The results clearly identified regions and months where ocean currents were more favourable for transport to suitable habitats. Tantabiddi, near Exmouth on the north-west coast, was consistently the best location for release for the oceanic species, with dominant offshore-directed currents and a very narrow continental shelf reducing the time taken for particles to be transported into deep water. In contrast, release locations with more enclosed geography, wide continental shelves, and/or proximity to cooler ocean temperatures were less successful. Our results produced a decision support system for the release of neonate marine turtles in Western Australia and our particle tracking approach has global transferability.</p>

This is especially true for sea turtles, whose complex life history and lengthy pelagic stage present unique conservation challenges. Few studies have explored how these young at-sea turtles navigate their environment, but advancements in satellite technology and numerical models have shown that active and passive movements are used in relation to open ocean features. Here, we provide the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to simultaneously combine a high-resolution physical forcing ocean circulation model with long-term multi-year tracking data of young, trans-oceanic North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles during their \&lsquo;lost years\&rsquo; at sea. From 2010 to 2014, we compare simulated trajectories of passive transport with empirical data of 1\&ndash;3 year old turtles released off Japan (29.7\&ndash;37.5 straight carapace length cm). After several years, the at-sea distribution of simulated current-driven trajectories significantly differed from that of the observed turtle tracks. These results underscore current theories on active dispersal by young oceanic-stage sea turtles and give further weight to hypotheses of juvenile foraging strategies for this species. Such information can also provide critical geographical information for spatially explicit conservation approaches to this endangered population.</p>

The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) advice for the sardine in regions VIII and IXa in 2013 indicated that the biomass has decreased since 2006 and recruitment has been below the long term average since 2005. Recruitment is very variable, so it is important to understand the underlying processes driving this variation in order to manage the fishery effectively. In this study, a biophysical model was used to simulate the early life (egg and larval) stages of sardine. A high resolution hydrodynamic model for North and Northwest Iberia was used to force a Lagrangian Individually-Based Model (IBM) that simulated advection and dispersion (both horizontal and vertical) and included some biological behaviour. A Lower Trophic Level (LTL) model coupled to the hydrodynamic model was also used to get some insight on recruitment for years 2006\&ndash;2007. Additionally, since in this area there are two different spawning grounds that could be associated with two eventually different populations, we have tried to show how the model can be used for giving insight on stock connectivity and therefore can contribute to stock delineation.</p>

However, there is no consistent approach to validating the spatial outputs of these models. In this study, we hope to rectify this gap. We document additions to an existing individual-based biophysical model for Alaska walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), some simulations made with this model and methods that were used to describe and compare spatial output of the model versus field data derived from ichthyoplankton surveys in the Gulf of Alaska. We used visual methods (e.g. distributional centroids with directional ellipses), several indices (such as a Normalized Difference Index (NDI), and an Overlap Coefficient (OC), and several statistical methods: the Syrjala method, the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, and a geostatistical method for comparing spatial indices. We assess the utility of these different methods in analyzing spatial output and comparing model output to data, and give recommendations for their appropriate use. Visual methods are useful for initial comparisons of model and data distributions. Metrics such as the NDI and OC give useful measures of co-location and overlap, but care must be taken in discretizing the fields into bins. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic is useful to determine the patchiness of the fields. The Syrjala method is an easily implemented statistical measure of the difference between the fields, but does not give information on the details of the distributions. Finally, the geostatistical comparison of spatial indices gives good information of details of the distributions and whether they differ significantly between the model and the data. We conclude that each technique gives quite different information about the model-data distribution comparison, and that some are easy to apply and some more complex. We also give recommendations for a multistep process to validate spatial output from IBMs.</p>

The angle of incidence of the incoming flow controls the nature of the wake on both sides and ends of the island, which changes from cyclonic to anticylonic wake flow, with either attached or shed eddies.

Our results revealed the role played by the consistent seasonal forcing of the wake flow on the recruitment patterns around the island at the interannual scale. The interannual variability of the timing of arrival and northward penetration of the plume instead controls the nature of the wake, hence the regional spatial recruitment patterns.</p>

Cell germinations and rDNA amplifications of A. minutum were obtained for sediments of all sampled stations, demonstrating that the whole bay is currently contaminated by this toxic species. Coherent estimations of ITS1rDNA copy numbers were obtained for the two sampling cruises, supporting the hypothesis of regular accumulation of A. minutum resting stages in the south-eastern, more confined embayments of the study area, where fine-muddy sediments are also more abundant. Higher ITS1rDNA copy numbers were detected in sediments of areas where blooms have been seasonally detected since 2012. This result suggests that specific genetic material estimations in superficial sediments of the bay may be a proxy of the cyst banks of A. minutum. The simulation of particle trajectory analyses by a Lagrangian physical model showed that blooms occurring in the south-eastern part of the bay are disconnected from those of the north-eastern zone. The heterogeneous distribution of A. minutum inferred from both water and sediment suggests the existence of potential barriers for the dispersal of this species in the Bay of Brest and encourages finer analyses at the population level for this species within semi-enclosed coastal ecosystems.</p>

	abstract = {<p>In marine benthic ecosystems, larval connectivity is a major process influencing the maintenance and distribution of invertebrate populations. Larval connectivity is a complex process to study as it is determined by several interacting factors. Here we use an individual-based, biophysical model, to disentangle the effects of such factors, namely larval vertical migration, larval growth, larval mortality, adults fecundity, and habitat availability, for the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas (loco) in Chile. Lower transport success and higher dispersal distances are observed including larval vertical migration in the model. We find an overall decrease in larval transport success to settlement areas from northern to southern Chile. This spatial gradient results from the combination of current direction and intensity, seawater temperature, and available habitat. From our simulated connectivity patterns we then identify subpopulations of loco along the Chilean coast, which could serve as a basis for spatial management of this resource in the future.</p>

We used a spatially-explicit Individual-based model (IBM) coupled to 6 years of a hydrodynamic model that simulates the early life history of walleye pollock in the \{GOA\} (eggs to age-0 juveniles). The processes modeled included growth, movement, mortality, feeding and the bioenergetics component for larvae and juveniles. Simulations were set to release particles on the 1st of the month (February to May) in fourteen historical spawning areas in the \{GOA\} up to the 1st of September each year. Model results reproduced the link between the Shelikof Strait spawning area and the Shumagin nursery region for March and April spawners, besides other Potential Nursery Areas (PNAs) found in the GOA. A prominent finding of this study was the appearance of the \{BS\} as important \{PNAs\} for several \{GOA\} spawning grounds, which is supported by a consistent flow into the \{BS\} through Unimak Pass. The simulations showed the highest density of simulated surviving pollock in the western Bering Sea (WBS) region with the lowest coefficients of variation of the whole domain. Three spawning sectors were defined, which aggregate multiple spawning areas in the eastern (EGOA), central (CGOA) and western Gulf of Alaska (WGOA). A connectivity matrix showed strong retention within the \{CGOA\} (25.9\%) and \{EGOA\} (23.8\%), but not in the \{WGOA\} (7.2\%). Within the GOA, the highest connectivity is observed from \{EGOA\} to \{CGOA\} (57.8\%) followed by the connection from \{CGOA\} to \{WGOA\} (24.3\%). Overall, one of the most prominent connections was from \{WGOA\} to \{WBS\} (62.8\%), followed by a connection from \{CGOA\} to \{WBS\} (29.2\%). In addition, scenarios of shifting spawning locations and nursery sectors of GOA, \{BS\} and \{AL\} are explored and implications for walleye pollock stock structure hypotheses are discussed.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Abstract The northwestern Iberian coast (Galician R\&iacute;as and shelf) is frequently affected by toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) (mainly Dinophysis spp.), leading to lengthy harvesting closures in a region where aquaculture has a strong socioeconomic impact. The project \{ASIMUTH\} (http://www.asimuth.eu) aimed to develop forecasting capabilities to warn of impending \{HABs\} along the European Atlantic coast. Simulations with the \{ROMS\} model (hydrodynamical and ecological simulations complemented with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations) of the Galician coastal circulation have been performed in the framework of the \{ASIMUTH\} project to characterize and forecast oceanographic conditions before and during \{HAB\} periods. In this work, we present the Galician \{ASIMUTH\} forecast system and demonstrate its skill in predicting \{HAB\} transport and its usefulness to provide assessment for the management of the areas affected by toxic outbreaks. Experience gained during \{DSP\} events in 2005 and 2013 is shown. We also describe the Galician pilot \{HAB\} bulletins, aimed at distributing forecasts of \{HAB\} events that might induce closures of harvesting areas or, when the areas are already closed, at giving information on forthcoming oceanographic conditions that could favour or hamper the opening of an area. Our results show that the model forecasts and the bulletins can provide early warning of the risk of Dinophysis spp. events and the risk of closures linked to the presence of \{DSP\} toxins above regulatory levels in harvesting areas.</p>

The fate of these deep-spawned hatchlings and their potential contribution to recruitment is as yet unknown. Lagrangian ROMS-IBM (Regional Ocean Modelling System-Individual-Based Model) simulations confirm westward transport of inshore and deep-spawned hatchlings, but also indicate that the potential exists for paralarvae hatched on the Eastern Agulhas Bank deep spawning grounds to be removed from the shelf\&nbsp;ecosystem. Using a ROMS-IBM, this study determined the transport and recruitment success of deep-spawned hatchlings relative to inshore-hatched paralarvae. A total of 12 release sites were incorporated into the model, six inshore and six deep-spawning sites. Paralarval survival was estimated based on timely transport to nursery grounds, adequate retention within the nursery grounds and retention on the Agulhas Bank shelf ({\textless}200\&nbsp;m). Paralarval transport and survival were dependent on both spawning location and time of hatching. Results suggest the importance of the south coast as a nursery area for inshore-hatched paralarvae, and similarly the cold ridge nursery grounds for deep-hatched paralarvae. Possible relationships between periods of highest recruitment success and spawning peaks were identified for both spawning habitats. Based on the likely autumn increase in deep spawning off the Tsitsikamma coast, and the beneficial currents during this period (as indicated by the model results) it can be concluded that deep spawning may at times contribute significantly to recruitment.</p>

	pages = {19},
	abstract = {<p>Sea turtles are capable of navigating across large expanses of ocean to arrive at remote islands for nesting, but how they do so has remained enigmatic. An interesting example involves green turtles (Chelonia mydas) that nest on Ascension Island, a tiny land mass located approximately 2000 km from the turtles\&rsquo; foraging grounds along the coast of Brazil. Sensory cues that turtles are known to detect, and which might hypothetically be used to help locate Ascension Island, include the geomagnetic field, airborne odorants, and waterborne odorants. One possibility is that turtles use magnetic cues to arrive in the vicinity of the island, then use chemical cues to pinpoint its location. As a first step toward investigating this hypothesis, we used oceanic, atmospheric, and geomagnetic models to assess whether magnetic and chemical cues might plausibly be used by turtles to locate Ascension Island. Results suggest that waterborne and airborne odorants alone are insufficient to guide turtles from Brazil to Ascension, but might permit localization of the island once turtles arrive in its vicinity. By contrast, magnetic cues might lead turtles into the vicinity of the island, but would not typically permit its localization because the field shifts gradually over time. Simulations reveal, however, that the sequential use of magnetic and chemical cues can potentially provide a robust navigational strategy for locating Ascension Island. Specifically, one strategy that appears viable is following a magnetic isoline into the vicinity of Ascension Island until an odor plume emanating from the island is encountered, after which turtles might either: (1) initiate a search strategy; or (2) follow the plume to its island source. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that sea turtles, and perhaps other marine animals, use a multi-modal navigational strategy for locating remote islands.</p>

While theoretical aspects of this work are reasonably well-developed, field-based validation is challenging. A much-needed study recently published by Briscoe and colleagues in Proceedings of the Royal Society B compared movements and distribution of satellite-tracked juvenile sea turtles to virtual particles released in a data-assimilating hindcast ocean circulation model. Substantial differences observed between turtles and particles were considered evidence for an important role of active swimming by turtles. However, the experimental design implicitly assumed that transport predictions were insensitive to (i) start location, (ii) tracking duration, (iii) depth, and (iv) physical processes not depicted in the model. Here, we show that the magnitude of variation in physical parameters between turtles and virtual particles can profoundly alter transport predictions, potentially sufficient to explain the reported differences without evoking swimming behaviour. We present a more robust method to derive the environmental contributions to individual movements, but caution that resolving the ocean velocities experienced by individual organisms remains a problem for assessing the role of behaviour in organismal movements and population distributions.</p>

Although many past studies have recognized the importance of this period in the benthic life cycle, knowledge of larval distribution in time and space remains limited, especially for high-latitude regions with pronounced seasonal variability in environmental conditions. Here, we present the first inventory of meroplankton over the continental shelf in the Lofoten-Vester\&aring;len region, northern Norway, over a full annual cycle. Six stations were sampled during 8 sampling events between September 2013 and August 2014. We recorded a total of 65 taxa, a considerably higher diversity than reported in studies from more northern regions. We observed a distinct seasonal pattern with characteristic meroplankton communities defining the seasons: spring, summer, and winter. Abundance and diversity during winter was low, with higher values in spring, and maximum abundances for most taxa in summer. Meroplankton community patterns did not reflect weak environmental spatial structure. Particle tracking was used to identify source and settlement locations of spring and summer communities. Spring and summer communities originated from shore and shelf areas, respectively. Larvae were generally transported toward Andfjord and adjacent shelf regions, irrespective of season. This spatially restricted dispersal and larval settlement highlights the importance of the local benthic communities for the resilience of the ecosystem.</p>

Here we challenge this assumption by conducting an experiment at the scale of an entire ocean basin to test whether small (\&sim;35 cm) juvenile loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta move independently of ocean currents. By comparing the trajectories of 46 satellite tracked turtles (11502 positions, 12850 tracking days) with Lagrangian drifters (3716303 positions, 927529 tracking days) and virtual particles tracked within the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), we found that in certain areas turtles moved in a similar manner to ocean currents, but in other areas turtle movement was markedly different from ocean currents, with turtles moving to areas thousands of kilometres from where they would have drifted passively. We further found that turtles were distributed in more-productive areas than would be expected if their movement depended on passive transport only. These findings demonstrate that regional variation in directional swimming contributes to young sea turtles reaching more favourable developmental habitats and supports laboratory work suggesting that young turtles have a map sense to determine their location in a seemingly featureless ocean.</p>

The abundance of turtles in the vicinity of the oil spill was derived by forward-tracking particles from focal beaches and integrating population size, oceanic-stage duration and stage-specific survival rates. Simulations indicated that 321 401 (66 199\&ndash;397 864) green (Chelonia mydas), loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Kemp\&$\#$39;s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) turtles were likely within the spill site.

This study combines the use of numerical models of the ocean and atmosphere, lagrangian tracking and biological aspects of {\.I}SAv\} infections. As in previous results, a wider dispersion of {\.I}SAv\} was observed during spring tides. Temporal changes in wind significantly modified the transport of viral particles from an infected center. Under similar forcing conditions, the areas of risk associated to culture sites separated by a few kilometers could be very different. Our main results remark the importance of the use of a detailed knowledge of hydrographic and atmospheric circulation in the definition of boundaries for sanitary management areas.

	abstract = {<p>Summary Although oceanic dispersal in larval and juvenile marine animals is widely studied, the relative contributions of swimming behavior and ocean currents to movements and distribution are poorly understood [1\&ndash;4]. The sea turtle \&ldquo;lost years\&rdquo; [5] (often referred to as the surface-pelagic [6] or oceanic [7] stage) are a\&nbsp;classic example. Upon hatching, young turtles migrate offshore and are rarely observed until they return to coastal waters as larger juveniles [5]. Sightings of small turtles downcurrent of nesting beaches and in association with drifting organisms (e.g., Sargassum algae) led to this stage being described as a \&ldquo;passive migration\&rdquo; during which turtles\&rsquo; movements are dictated by ocean currents [5\&ndash;10]. However, laboratory and modeling studies suggest that dispersal trajectories might also be shaped by oriented swimming [11\&ndash;15]. Here, we use an experimental approach designed to directly test the passive-migration hypothesis by deploying pairs of surface drifters alongside small green (Chelonia mydas) and Kemp\&rsquo;s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) wild-caught turtles, tracking their movements via satellite telemetry. We conclusively demonstrate that these turtles do not behave as passive drifters. In nearly all cases, drifter trajectories were uncharacteristic of turtle trajectories. Species-specific and location-dependent oriented swimming behavior, inferred by subtracting track velocity from modeled ocean velocity, contributed substantially to individual movement and distribution. These findings highlight the importance of in\&nbsp;situ observations for depicting the dispersal of weakly swimming animals. Such observations, paired with information on the mechanisms of orientation, will likely allow for more accurate predictions of the ecological and evolutionary processes shaped by animal movement.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Sardinella aurita is the most abundant small pelagic fish in the Senegalese\&ndash;Mauritanian region. The success of its reproduction crucially depends on the local circulation as this determines whether larvae reach coastal nursery areas favorable to their survival or are dispersed into the open ocean. As a first step towards evaluating sardinella vulnerability to climate-driven hydrodynamical changes, this study aims at underpinning how transport pathways drive optimal spatial and seasonal patterns for sardinella reproduction. We have used two estimates of the Senegalese\&ndash;Mauritanian coastal seasonal circulation simulated by two hydrodynamical model configurations that differ in their forcing and topography. Nursery areas are determined by evaluating coastal retention with a Lagrangian individual-based model that accounts for processes such as diel vertical migration and mortality as a result of lethal temperature exposure. Our results suggest that\&nbsp;the shelf zones located at the Arguin Bank (19.5\&deg;N\&ndash;21\&deg;N) and south of Senegal (12\&deg;N\&ndash;14.75\&deg;N) are highly retentive. We find maximum retention rates in July\&ndash;August and November\&ndash;December over the Arguin Bank; from February\&ndash;July and November\&ndash;December over the southern Senegalese shelf; and lower retention rates over the central region (14.75\&deg;N\&ndash;19.5\&deg;N) that are locally maximum in June\&ndash;July when the upwelling weakens. These retention areas and their seasonality are in agreement with previously reported spawning patterns, suggesting that the Sardinella aurita spawning strategy may result from a trade-off between retention patterns associated with the seasonal circulation and food availability. Exposure to lethal temperatures, although not well studied, could be a further limiting factor for spawning. The Lagrangian analysis reveals important connectivity between sub-regions within and south of the system and hence underlines the importance for joint management of the Sardinella aurita stock.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Protected areas (PAs) are recognized as the flagship tool to offset biodiversity loss on Earth. Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence, several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these, the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far, this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design. However, a more cost-effective and realistic approach is to optimize the design of an extended network to improve its connectivity and thus population persistence. Here, we develop a flexible algorithm based on eigenvalue decomposition of connectivity matrices to extend existing networks of PAs while optimizing connectivity and population growth rate. We also include a splitting algorithm to improve cluster identification. The new algorithm accounts for the change in connectivity due to the increased biological productivity often observed in existing PAs. We illustrate the potential of our algorithm by proposing an extension of the network of \&sim;100 Mediterranean marine PAs to reach the targeted 10\% surface area protection from the current 1.8\%. We identify differences between the clean slate scenario, where all sites are available for protection, irrespective of their current protection status, and the scenario where existing PAs are forced to be included into the optimized solution. By integrating this algorithm to existing multi-objective and multi-specific algorithms of PA selection, the demographic effects of connectivity can be explicitly included into conservation planning.</p>

Although guidance mechanisms are usually studied under controlled laboratory conditions, such methods seldom allow for navigation behavior to be examined in an environmental context. Similarly, although realistic environmental models are often used to investigate the ecological implications of animal movement, explicit consideration of navigation mechanisms in such models is rare. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach in which we first conducted lab-based experiments to determine how hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) respond to magnetic fields that exist at five widely separated locations along their migratory route, and then studied the consequences of the observed behavior by simulating it within an ocean circulation model. Magnetic fields associated with two geographic regions that pose risks to young turtles (due to cold wintertime temperatures or potential displacement from the migratory route) elicited oriented swimming, whereas fields from three locations where surface currents and temperature pose no such risk did not. Additionally, at locations with fields that elicited oriented swimming, simulations indicate that the observed behavior greatly increases the likelihood of turtles advancing along the migratory pathway. Our findings suggest that the magnetic navigation behavior of sea turtles is intimately tied to their oceanic ecology and is shaped by a complex interplay between ocean circulation and geomagnetic dynamics.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Abstract Along the coast of Chile, fisheries targeting the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, commonly named \&ldquo;loco\&rdquo;, were highly valuable until the end of the 80s when catches declined significantly. Since the late 90s, a management plan based on territorial-user-rights areas has been implemented, with limited effect on stock recovery. More effective loco conservation and management is impeded by lack of information regarding connectivity via larval dispersal between these individually-managed areas. To develop a regional view of loco connectivity, we integrate loco life history information into a biophysical, individual-based larval dispersal model. This model is used to evaluate scales of loco connectivity and seasonality in connectivity patterns, as well as to partition the coast into largely disconnected subpopulations using a recently developed connectivity-matrix clustering algorithm. We find mean dispersal distances ranging from 170 to 220\&nbsp;km depending on release depth of larvae and planktonic larval duration. Settlement success levels depend quantitatively on the physical and biological processes included in the model, but connectivity patterns remain qualitatively similar. Model estimates of settlement success peak for larval release dates in late austral autumn, consistent with field results and with favorable conditions for larval coastal retention due to weak upwelling during austral autumn. Despite the relatively homogeneous Chilean coastline, distinct subpopulations with minimal connectivity between them are readily identifiable. Barriers to connectivity that are robust to changes in model configuration exist at 23\&deg;S and 29\&deg;S latitudes. These zones are all associated with important headlands and embayments of the Chilean coast.</p>

Two spawning experiments were performed for the summer along six years, coincident with ichthyoplankton survey cruises. In the first one, eggs were released in spawning habitats inferred from a spatial model. The second experiment simulated a random spawning to test the null hypothesis that there are no preferred spawning sites. Releasing eggs in the predefined spawning habitats increases larval survival, suggesting that the central-southern part of the {SBB} is more suitable for larvae development because of its thermodynamic characteristics. The Brazilian sardine is also capable of exploring suitable areas for spawning, according to the interannual variability of the {SBB}. The influence of water temperature, the presence of Cape Frio upwelling, and surface circulation on the spawning process was tested. The Cape Frio upwelling plays an important role in the modulation of Brazilian sardine spawning zones over {SBB} because of its lower than average water temperature. This has a direct influence on larval survival and on the interannual variability of the Brazilian sardine spawning process. The hydrodynamic condition is crucial in determining the central-southern part of {SBB} as the most suitable place for spawning because it enhances simulated coastal retention of larvae.},

	abstract = {Abstract Long-distance dispersal and ontogenetic shifts in habitat use are characteristic of numerous marine species and have important ecological, evolutionary, and management implications. These processes, however, are often challenging to study due to the vast areas involved. We used genetic markers and simulations of physical transport within an ocean circulation model to gain understanding into the origin of juvenile hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) found at Ascension Island, a foraging ground that is thousands of kilometers from known nesting beaches. Regional origin of genetic markers suggests that turtles are from Western Atlantic (86\%) and Eastern Atlantic (14\%) rookeries. In contrast, numerical simulations of transport by ocean currents suggest that passive dispersal from the western sources would be negligible and instead would primarily be from the East, involving rookeries along Western Africa (i.e., Principe Island) and, potentially, from as far as the Indian Ocean (e.g., Mayotte and the Seychelles). Given that genetic analysis identified the presence of a haplotype endemic to Brazilian hawksbill rookeries at Ascension, we examined the possible role of swimming behavior by juvenile hawksbills from {NE} Brazil on their current-borne transport to Ascension Island by performing numerical experiments in which swimming behavior was simulated for virtual particles (simulated turtles). We found that oriented swimming substantially influenced the distribution of particles, greatly altering the proportion of particles dispersing into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic. Assigning location-dependent orientation behavior to particles allowed them to reach Ascension Island, remain in favorable temperatures, encounter productive foraging areas, and return to the vicinity of their natal site. The age at first arrival to Ascension (4.5{\textendash}5.5 years) of these particles corresponded well to estimates of hawksbill age based on their size. Our findings suggest that ocean currents and swimming behavior play an important role in the oceanic ecology of sea turtles and other marine animals.},

We propose that observed spatial patterns in LPM distribution resulted from the timing and location of surface phytoplankton bloom, lateral transport, microbial processes in the core of the OMZ, and enhanced biological processes mediated by bacteria and zooplankton at the lower oxycline. Indeed, satellite-derived net primary production maps showed that the northern stations of the transect were under the influence of a previous major bloom event while the most southern stations were in a more oligotrophic situation. Lagrangian simulations of particle transport showed that deep particles of the northern stations could originate from the surface bloom while the southern stations could be considered as driven by 1-D vertical processes. In the first 200 m of the OMZ core, minima in nitrate concentrations and the intermediate nepheloid layer (INL) coincided with high concentrations of 100 \&mu;m \&lt; LPM \&lt; 200 \&mu;m. These particles could correspond to colonies of bacteria or detritus produced by anaerobic microbial activity. However, the calculated carbon flux through this layer was not affected. Vertical profiles of carbon flux indicate low flux attenuation in the OMZ, with a Martin model b exponent value of 0.22. At three stations, the lower oxycline was associated to a deep nepheloid layer, an increase of calculated carbon flux and an increase in mesozooplankton abundance. Enhanced bacterial activity and zooplankton feeding in the deep OMZ is proposed as a mechanism for the observed deep particle aggregation. Estimated lower flux attenuation in the upper OMZ and re-aggregation at the lower oxycline suggest that OMZ may be regions of enhanced carbon flux to the deep sea relative to non OMZ regions.</span></p>

Further, our modelling results indicated that turtles could potentially drift from rookeries to Palmyra Atoll via surface currents along a near-Equatorial swathe traversing the Pacific. Comparing findings from genetics and modelling highlighted the complex impacts of ocean currents and behaviour on natal origins. Although the Palmyra feeding ground was highly differentiated genetically from others in the Indo-Pacific, there was no significant differentiation among years, sexes or stage-classes at the Refuge. Understanding the distribution of this foraging population advances knowledge of green turtles and contributes to effective conservation planning for this threatened species.},

This region sustains historical landings of the tropical arrow squid Doryteuthis plei. As in other coleoid cephalopods, the broodstock dies following spawning and the continuance of the population relies exclusively upon the survival of the paralarvae, which are very sensitive to oceanographic conditions. As a first step towards the understanding of paralarval transport, the shelf area was evaluated in terms of retention/dispersion potential. A Lagrangian particle-tracking Individual-Based Model was set up using a 3D Princeton Ocean Model model forced with in situ data obtained from July 2009 to July 2011. Neutrally buoyant particles were released every first day of every month in the model, and tracked for 30 days. The retention potential was high for particles released from the bottom all over the study area from the coast to the shelf break (200 m isobath). Offshore losses showed a marked seasonality. Regarding inshore losses, the percentage of particles beached was constant year round and smaller than offshore losses, being higher south of 24{\textdegree}S. Simulation results seem to agree with present knowledge of the reproductive behaviour of the species in the region.},

We focus on a reef fish species, the humbug damselfish Dascyllus aruanus, to investigate seasonal variability of simulated larval retention at the scale of a reef patch and at the scale of the lagoon, and to explore links between larval retention and wind variability. The model shows that retention exhibits considerable temporal variability and periodically reaches values much larger than anticipated. Non-zero larval settlement occurs over a large part of the lagoon. Nevertheless, settlement values decrease quickly away from the natal reef and mean dispersal distances are of order 25{\textendash}35 km. Cross-correlation analyses indicate that weather conditions characterized by strong south east trade winds lead to low retention rates at both local (reef) and regional (lagoon) scales. By contrast, subtropical weather conditions characterized by weak winds result in high retention rates. These results suggest that large-scale weather regimes can be used as proxies for larval retention of the humbug damselfish in the South-West Lagoon of New Caledonia. Nevertheless, relatively small mean dispersal distances suggest that metapopulation dynamics occur on relatively small spatial scales.},

	abstract = {The Humboldt Current System ({HCS}) sustains the world's largest small pelagic fishery. While a cooling of this system has been observed during recent decades, there is debate about the potential impacts of rising atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations on upwelling dynamics and productivity. Recent studies suggest that under increased atmospheric {CO}2 scenarios the oceanic stratification may strongly increase and upwelling-favorable winds may remain nearly constant off Peru and increase off Chile. Here we investigate the impact of such climatic conditions on egg and larval dispersal phases, a key stage of small pelagic fish reproduction. We used larval retention rate in a predefined nursery area to provide a proxy for the recruitment level. Numerical experiments are based on hydrodynamics downscaled to the {HCS} from global simulations forced by pre-industrial ({PI}), 2 {\texttimes} {CO}2 and 4 {\texttimes} {CO}2 scenarios. A biogeochemical model is applied to the {PI} and 4 {\texttimes} {CO}2 scenarios to define a time-variable nursery area where larval survival is optimum. We test two distinct values of the oxycline depth that limits larval vertical distribution: One corresponding to the present-day situation and the other corresponding to a shallower oxycline potentially produced by climate change. It appeared that larval retention over the continental shelf increases with enhanced stratification due to regional warming. However, this increase in retention is largely compensated for by a decrease of the nursery area and the shoaling of the oxycline. The underlying dynamics are explained by a combination of stratification effects and mesoscale activity changes. Our results therefore show that future climate change may significantly reduce fish capacity in the {HCS} with strong ecological, economic and social consequences.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas ({MPAs}) are major tools to protect biodiversity and sustain fisheries. For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of {MPA} networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between {MPAs} remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between {MPAs} in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred {MPAs}. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean {MPAs} are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each {MPA} was directly connected to four others and {MPAs} were clustered into several groups. Two {MPAs} (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of {MPA} distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20\% of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected {MPAs} providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more.},

This work (I) demonstrates the key role played by the use of the realistic initial position of the eggs of small pelagic fishes in the analysis of late-larval recruitment in coastal nursery areas and ({II}) provides a general solution for deriving future egg positions and abundances from adult biomass obtained from acoustic surveys and available fecundity data. Using European anchovy in the {NW} Mediterranean as a case study, we first analyzed the impact of the initial location, timing, egg buoyancy and diel vertical migration of larvae on the potential late-larval recruitment to coastal areas. The results suggested that prior knowledge of the initial spawning grounds may substantially affect the estimates of potential recruitment. We then integrated biological and acoustics-derived data (the biomass and size structure, sex ratio, a weight-batch fecundity model, mean weight, number of fish and mean spawning) to build a predictive model for interannual egg production. This model was satisfactorily contrasted with field data for two years obtained with the Daily Egg Production Method ({DEPM}). We discuss our results in the context of the fluctuations of European anchovy egg abundance from 2003 through 2010 in the {NW} Mediterranean and in terms of the potential applicability of the acoustics-based spatial predictive egg production model.},

Using a recently developed 3D coupled physical-biogeochemical model that considers the complex ocean-lagoon interface, we aim to understand better the impact of the upwelling on the lagoon. The model was found to be in good agreement with measured data reported in previous publications about two upwelling events. However, in general, levels of surface chlorophyll-a were overestimated by the model in the upwelling area when compared to ocean colour data and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the discrepancy. We then tracked rich upwelled water using a forward Lagrangian transport analysis. Upwelled waters from the upper nutricline were found to be able to reach the South West lagoon. An anti-cyclonic eddy was detected near the upwelling area, potentially responsible, in part, for the rich water intrusions into the lagoon.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Upogebia pusilla and U. deltaura are 2 common ghost shrimp species occurring in estuaries and over the shelves of European coasts, respectively. The adults have a great impact on benthic habitats and communities, as they depend on sandy and muddy substrates to construct long burrows that provide shelter and appropriate conditions for reproduction and feeding. Their planktonic larval phase lasts around 3 wk and consists of 4 zoeal stages and a decapodid that must settle in the benthos before recruiting to adult populations. In situ data were obtained from {CTD} casts and plankton hauls during an oceanographic survey that took place along the southern Portuguese coast in August 2010. All zoeal stages and decapodids of both species were found distributed over the shelf not exceeding 30 km from the coastline. A modelling approach was used to explain the differences in dispersal of these Upogebia congeners inhabiting different habitats of the same geographic area and exposed to similar oceanographic conditions. Their vertical distribution, oceanic circulation and the points of larval release were considered. A different dispersal strategy, influenced by natal origin and vertical behaviour, was evident for each species. The presence of decapodid stages close to substrates suitable for settlement where adult populations occur, especially for U. deltaura, suggests a good probability of successful settlement. Dispersal patterns observed for the 2 species and the agreement between field observations and model simulations indicate that these species are good models for other coastal invertebrates that reproduce in summer and have short larval development.},

Results of hydrodynamic modelling are validated against the tidal gauge data, {VHF} radar surface velocities and {ADCP} measurements. Lagrangian tracking experiments are performed with passive particles to study tracer dispersal along the northern French coast, with special emphasis on the {BLH}. Simulations revealed an anticyclonic eddy generated in the harbour at rising tide. Tracers, released during flood tide at the Liane river mouth, move northward with powerful clockwise rotating current. After the high water, the current direction changes to westward, and tracers leave the harbour through the open boundary. During ebb tide, currents convergence along the western open boundary but no eddy is formed, surface currents inside the harbour are much weaker and the tracer excursion length is small. After the current reversal at low water, particles are advected shoreward resulting in a significant increase of the residence time of tracers released during ebb tide. The effect of wind on particle dispersion was found to be particularly strong. Under strong {SW} wind, the residence time of particles released during flood tide increases from 1.5 to 6 days. For release during ebb tide, {SW} wind weakens the southward tidally induced drift and thus the residence time decreases. Similar effects are observed when the freshwater inflow to the harbour is increased from 2 to 10 m3/s during the ebb tide flow. For flood tide conditions, the effect of freshwater inflow is less significant. We also demonstrate an example of innovative coastal management targeted at the reduction of the residence time of the pathogenic material accidentally released in the harbour.},

By using a 3D {ROMS} hydrodynamic model coupled to an individual-based model ({IBM}) of the larval stages of the European anchovy, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) the plausible effective spawning zones (those generating late larvae to the known nursery grounds) are mainly found in the vicinity of Malaga Bay, as suggested by published empirical data; (2) the observed, back-calculated growth of larvae sampled in the nursery grounds can be reasonably simulated by a simple temperature-dependent growth model; and (3) the inclusion of biological behavior in the {IBM} significantly improves the match between the observed and modeled late-larval recruitment and/or growth patterns. We performed simulations for the peak spawning season in 2008, for which survey data were available, and an average climatological run. Hypothesis 1 was accepted, whereas hypothesis 2 resulted in a good imitation of anchovy growth only after 10 days post-hatch. The inclusion of an empirically derived equation for egg buoyancy in the model (hypothesis 3) resulted in a slight improvement of the model of late-larval recruitment patterns. Finally, our model was used to explore possible retention-based nursery areas in the whole Alboran Sea. Our simulations showed to agree well with the existing data both in the European and in the African coast and confer the physics a dominant role in shaping the spatial dynamics of early life stages of anchovy in the area.},

Many recent studies tout the use of {\textquoteleft}high-resolution{\textquoteright} models, which are forced with atmospheric data on the scale of several hours and integrated with a time step of several minutes or seconds. However, in many cases, the model{\textquoteright}s outputs that are used to simulate organism movement have been averaged to considerably coarser resolutions (e.g. monthly mean velocity fields). To examine the sensitivity of tracking results to ocean circulation model output resolution, we took the native model output of one of the most sophisticated ocean circulation models available, the Global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, and averaged it to commonly implemented spatial and temporal resolutions in studies of basin-scale dispersal. Comparisons between simulated particle trajectories and in situ near-surface drifter trajectories indicated that {\textquoteleft}over averaging{\textquoteright} model output yields predictions inconsistent with observations. Further analyses focused on the dispersal of juvenile sea turtles indicate that very different inferences regarding the pelagic ecology of these animals are obtained depending on the resolution of model output. We conclude that physical processes occurring at the scale of days and tens of kilometres should be preserved in ocean circulation model output to realistically depict the movement marine organisms and the resulting ecological and evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {Small pelagic fish populations exhibit reproductive strategies resulting from past natural selection pressure, by which certain traits become more or less common in a population, allowing them to adapt and become better suited to certain habitats. One such adaptation is the buoyancy of eggs, which is observed as density changes during development. This is an important issue in fisheries and modeling science, as it affects the vertical distribution of eggs and, therefore, egg transport. Recently, individual-based models for anchovies in the Mediterranean have focused on developing adequate biological algorithms to simulate realistic spatial variations of eggs and larvae. Some models that include movements of particles according to Stokes{\textquoteright} law also assume a constant value of egg density during egg development. However, field observations show differences in the vertical distribution of eggs when egg density during development is considered. We address the problem of egg density and its vertical distribution within a biological context. In Mediterranean waters, the incubation time for anchovy eggs during peak spawning is approximately 48{\textendash}70 h; during these first hours, egg density has an influence on the horizontal and vertical trajectories of eggs, as well as their routes and hatching zones. In this study, we introduce an algorithm describing the egg density of European anchovy eggs throughout development. Egg density measurements were carried out in a density gradient column ({DGC}). We fitted a polynomial model that estimated egg density, as a function of time from fertilization and that was dependent on temperature. Simulations to study the vertical transport of eggs in the Mediterranean were carried out using {ICHTHYOP}/{MARS}3D. The vertical distribution of pelagic eggs was determined by a set of interacting biological and physical parameters related to eggs (density, diameter) and ambient seawater (density, viscosity, turbulence), respectively. The egg buoyancy model introduced here was validated and will provide insight for the design of anchovy egg surveys, as the vertical position of the eggs in the water column during development can be inferred by the hydrographic structure of seawater.},

We aimed to identify the main larval transport/retention characteristics in the study area, which constitutes the southernmost P. monodon fishing grounds embedded in the Humboldt Current System. We hypothesized that the main contribution to population renewal originates in the two persistent adult aggregations close to the nursery ground that occurs over a continental shelf terrace limited by two submarine canyons. Two extensive bio-physical field campaigns were carried out during the main 2001{\textendash}2002 upwelling season field data indicated that larvae were released from late austral winter to spring from spots to the north and south of the nursery. Zoea I were found mainly below 50 m depth in southward-flowing waters, whereas older zoea dominated in northward flowing layers above 50 m. Larvae were circumscribed between the coast and the shelf break front and pelagic retention areas were identified over the widest shelf area. Megalopa and juveniles during March, were only found over the nursery area. Individual based simulations coupled to the output of a hydrodynamic model (climatological configuration) for the studied area, showed that the release sites close to the nursery made the largest contribution to recruitment. Sites further north could also contribute to recruitment if hatching occurred later in the upwelling season. The contribution of vertical behavior to larval success was also important, as was the former{\textquoteright}s interaction with the site and time of larval release. Our results support the relevance of coastal circulation (affected by topography) on the persistence of P. monodon populations off southern Chile, and the modulation of temporal variability. These results might apply to other abundant species in the area.},

Recruitment is a key process in the dynamics of marine organisms, yet very little is known about the early life history of Cape hakes, especially the location of spawning grounds and transport of eggs and larvae. For each species, ichthyoplankton dispersal off South Africa is simulated by coupling oceanographic simulations to an individual-based model in order to track virtual individuals. Results indicate that the most favorable spawning areas for transport to nursery areas are located off the south-western coast and the eastern Agulhas Bank, and highlight partly different drift routes followed by the two ichthyoplankton species off Cape Columbine. Transport from spawning to nursery areas is the highest in austral winter for a spawning depth ranging between 0 and 100 m. These modeling results are in broad agreement with available knowledge on the ecology of Cape hakes. The present work on Cape hakes complements previous modeling studies on anchovy and sardine in the same area. Taken together, these studies underline the correspondence between cross-shore (for hakes) or alongshore (for anchovy and sardine) transport mechanisms and the spawning strategies used by these key species of the southern Benguela ecosystem.},

Loggerheads possess a {\textquoteleft}magnetic map{\textquoteright} in which regional magnetic fields elicit changes in swimming direction along the migratory pathway. In some geographic areas, however, ocean currents move more rapidly than young turtles can swim. Thus, the degree to which turtles can control their migratory movements has remained unclear. In this study, the movements of young turtles were simulated within a high-resolution ocean circulation model using several different behavioral scenarios, including one in which turtles drifted passively and others in which turtles swam briefly in accordance with experimentally derived data on magnetic navigation. Results revealed that small amounts of oriented swimming in response to regional magnetic fields profoundly affected migratory routes and endpoints. Turtles that engaged in directed swimming for as little as 1{\textendash}3 h per day were 43{\textendash}187\% more likely than passive drifters to reach the Azores, a productive foraging area frequented by Florida loggerheads. They were also more likely to remain within warm-water currents favorable for growth and survival, avoid areas on the perimeter of the migratory route where predation risk and thermal conditions pose threats, and successfully return to the open-sea migratory route if carried into coastal areas. These findings imply that even weakly swimming marine animals may be able to exert strong effects on their migratory trajectories and open-sea distributions through simple navigation responses and minimal swimming.},

	abstract = {Recruitment of European anchovy has been traditionally thought to largely depend on the passive transport and dispersion of eggs and larvae from spawning to nursery areas. Knowledge of the factors influencing the vertical distribution of fish early stages, and consequently influencing the transport, is a crucial issue in fisheries science. The aim of this study is to assess the relevance of diel vertical migration ({DVM}) as a mechanism involved in the transport of European anchovy larvae toward nursery areas taking into account age/stage-dependent vertical migration (i.e., the maximum migration). We developed a simplified vertical migration sub-model for anchovy larvae included in an Individual-based ({IBM}) hydrodynamic coupled model. Two types of simulation experiments were conducted: (1) {\textquoteleft}Pure{\textquoteright} Lagrangian (passive) transport experiments and (2) biological behavior transport experiments with a realistic scheme for egg-buoyancy, larval growth, and {DVM} scheme. We detected high variability in the trajectory and final position of larvae with 14 mm length between the passive and biological behavior experiments. The particles were less clustered in the passive transport experiment. In the biological experiment the particles were aggregated depending on the mesoscale oceanographic structures, evidencing a transport associated to filaments and meanders. The formation of schools was facilitated by the transport in filaments and larvae transported within filaments generally avoided the nucleus of the eddies and the central part of the North Current. Moreover, our results suggest that there is interconnectivity between all the anchovy sub-populations in the {NW} Mediterranean and that the Gulf of Lions and the shelf waters surrounding the Ebro River Delta are the most important areas for anchovy reproduction in this region. Additionally, we detected that the pre-recruitment is higher in those years when the larvae retention is favored. We underline that bottlenecks in larval transport modeling are related to the scarcity of knowledge in developmental biology and behavior of anchovy larvae and emergent mechanistic processes.},

However, (1) filaments are not the only mechanism, and (2) filament presence does not necessarily imply larval transport. Anchovy and sardine larval presence at {GC} appears to be independent of the respective adult spawning seasonality. Combining of observed and modeled data does not succeed in reproducing the observed larval patterns at {GC}.

Specific gravity is an important parameter in the dispersal of marine zooplankton, because the velocity of currents, and therefore the speed of transport, is usually greatest near the surface. For the South African chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii), recruitment is thought to be influenced by the successful transport of paralarvae from the spawning grounds to a food-rich feature known as the cold ridge some 100{\textendash}200 km away. The role of paralarval specific gravity on such transport is investigated. Specific gravity ranged from 1.0373 to 1.0734 g cm-3 during the yolk-utilization phase, implying that paralarvae are always negatively buoyant, regardless of yolk content. The data were incorporated into a coupled individual-based model ({IBM}){\textemdash}Regional Ocean Modelling System model. The output showed that dispersal was dominantly westward towards the cold ridge. Also, modelled paralarval vertical distribution suggested that hydrodynamic turbulence was an important factor in dispersal. The negative buoyancy of early chokka squid paralarvae may reduce the risk of paralarvae being advected off the eastern Agulhas Bank and into the open ocean, where food is less abundant, so specific gravity may be important in enhancing the survival and recruitment of chokka squid.},

	abstract = {Present knowledge of ocean currents based on in situ observation and models suggests that passive biological material such as eggs and larvae can be advected offshore away from the Agulhas Bank, South Africa, and hence removed from the ecosystem on which their survival and recruitment depends. Such losses have been cited as the root cause of the sudden drop in annual squid catches experienced in 2001. In this study, a Lagrangian {IBM} (individual-based model) coupled to a {ROMS} (regional ocean model system) model was used to investigate this hypothesis. Three simulations were performed for 12 model months using neutrally buoyant particles released from the seabed (120 m) every second day on the mid-shelf of the eastern, central and western regions of the Agulhas Bank. Boundary effects and resolution precluded the release of virtual particles on the inshore spawning grounds. Particles were given lifespans of 40 days. Results demonstrated large particle losses from the eastern Agulhas Bank (76\%) and the western Agulhas Bank (64\%). In contrast, few particles were lost from the central Agulhas Bank (2\%), making this, in terms of the model, the most suitable place on the Agulhas Bank for spawning. Visualisation of the {ROMS} outputs revealed that leakage on the eastern Agulhas Bank was caused by a cyclonic eddy resident in the Agulhas Bight. Similarly, leakage from the western Agulhas Bank was caused by deep-water cyclonic eddies in the adjacent Atlantic Ocean.},

For migratory animals, fitness depends, in part, on producing offspring that migrate successfully to habitats suitable for the next life-history stage. Thus, natural selection might favor reproduction in locations with conditions that facilitate the migration of offspring. To investigate this concept, we studied the Kemp{\textquoteright}s ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) to determine whether coastal areas with the highest levels of nesting have particularly favorable conditions for hatchling migration. We modeled the passive drift of young Kemp{\textquoteright}s ridley turtles from seven nesting regions within the Gulf of Mexico to foraging grounds using the particle-tracking program {ICHTHYOP} and surface-current output from {HYCOM} ({HYbrid} Coordinate Ocean Model). Results revealed that geographic regions with conditions that facilitate successful migration to foraging grounds typically have higher abundance of nests than do regions where oceanographic conditions are less favorable and successful migration is difficult for hatchlings. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, for the Kemp{\textquoteright}s ridley turtle and perhaps for other migrants, patterns of abundance across the breeding range are shaped in part by conditions that promote or impede the successful migration of offspring.},

The factors influencing its recruitment are crucial to fisheries and ecological research. Among those factors transport of larvae by hydrodynamics (currents) is important because it determines whether the organisms can reach areas favourable to recruitment or are dispersed.

Several years (2001{\textendash}2008) of hydrodynamics were simulated with the {MARS}-3D code. The resulting simulated currents and salinity are used by Lagrangian tool, Ichthyop, to transport anchovy eggs and larvae to the Western Mediterranean Sea.

Here we used a similar method, i.e., an individual-based model of the natal homing reproductive strategy, and applied it to other upwelling systems: the northern Humboldt Current system off Peru, the southern Humboldt Current system off Chile and the central Canary Current system off Morocco. We investigated the spatial (horizontal and vertical) and seasonal spawning patterns that emerged after applying different environmental constraints in the model, and compared these to observed spawning patterns of sardine and anchovy in their respective systems. The selective environmental constraints tested were: (1) lethal temperature; (2) retention over the continental shelf; and (3) avoidance of dispersive structures. Simulated horizontal spatial patterns and seasonal patterns compared reasonably well with field data, but vertical patterns in most cases did not. Similarly to what was found for the southern Benguela, temperature was a determinant constraint in the southern Humboldt. The shelf retention constraint led to selection of a particular spawning season during the period of minimum upwelling in all three of the upwelling regions considered, and to spatial patterns that matched observed anchovy spawning off Chile and sardine spawning off Morocco. The third constraint, avoidance of dispersive structures, led to the emergence of a spawning season during the period of maximum upwelling off Chile and Morocco, but not in Peru. The most accurate representation of observed spatio-temporal spawning patterns off Peru was achieved through a combination of shelf retention and non-dispersion constraints.},

These hypotheses were that: (1) {DVM} enhances alongshore transport of anchovy eggs and larvae from the spawning grounds to the nursery area while avoiding the lethal effect of low water temperatures in the upwelling system, and/or (2) {DVM} enhances the transport of larvae and pre-recruits from the offshore to the onshore domain of the nursery area, and then counteracts offshore advection by favouring retention. We tracked the trajectories of virtual particles in the model and calculated a pre-recruitment index as a proxy for transport success to the nursery area (onshore and offshore) and found that the index increased from 10\% to 20\% after the incorporation of larval vertical migration into the {IBM}, with virtual individuals held at depths of around 60 m showing maximal pre-recruitment index values. Hence, {DVM} does appear to enhance transport to the nursery area (offshore) for early and late larvae. Model outputs showed coarse-scale horizontal distribution patterns of larvae by age/size class that are similar to field observations for early, small larvae but not for large larvae and pre-recruits. Observations show that early/small larvae are located offshore whereas older/larger larvae and pre-recruits are found closer to the continental shelf and the inner nursery grounds. This disparity between model results and field observations does not support the hypothesis that {DVM} is one of the mechanisms involved in the onshore movement of early life-history stages, especially for large larvae.},

	abstract = {We used an individual-based model of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) early life history coupled with hydrodynamic outputs from the regional oceanic modeling system ({ROMS}) to investigate the factors driving variability in egg and larval survival rates in the northern Humboldt upwelling region off Peru. Individuals were released within a coastal area and followed for a period of 30 days. Those that were still in the coastal area at that time were considered as retained. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability in the release locations of the individuals retained, and compared these to observed egg concentration patterns reconstructed from a 40-year period of monitoring. A first set of simulations using passive particles to represent anchovy eggs and larvae revealed a large sensitivity of the results to the initial vertical distribution of particles. We then conducted two additional sets of simulations that included the effect of egg buoyancy, larval vertical swimming behavior and lethal temperature. We obtained (1) maximal coastal retention close to the surface in winter and in deeper layers in summer, (2) a large influence of egg buoyancy and of larval vertical behavior on coastal retention in all seasons, (3) a partial match between dates and locations of enhanced retention and observed egg concentration patterns and (4) a low effect of lethal temperature on survival except when associated with high egg density. The model suggests that an optimal temporal spawning pattern for maximizing coastal retention would have two maximums, the most significant in austral winter and the second in summer. This pattern agrees roughly with observed spawning seasonality, but with temporal discrepancy of about two months in the peaks of both series. Spatially, we obtained higher retention from 10 S to 20 S, whereas the observed maximum egg concentration was located between 6{\textdegree}S and 14{\textdegree}S. Among the three sets of simulations, the one taking into account larval vertical swimming behavior lead to the best match with the data.},

It sustains a large amount of small pelagic fish, mainly sardine (Sardina pilchardus; Sardinella spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). One of the particularities of this system is the presence of the Canary archipelago, which is close enough to the continental coast to allow exchange of biological material between the two areas. We used intermediate-resolution (7 km) hydrodynamic simulations as inputs for an individual-based model to assess the transport of ichthyoplankton (i) along the African coast and (ii) from the African coast to the Canary archipelago. We explored different scenarios of passive versus active vertically swimming larvae to assess the possible impact of vertical migration on transport and retention. Transport along the coast was essentially southward. The zone located between Cape Dr{\^a}a (\~{}28{\textdegree}45'N) and Cape Juby (\~{}27{\textdegree}56 N) had relatively high levels of retention in autumn and winter. The zone extending from Cape Boujdor (\~{}26{\textdegree}12'N) up to Cape Blanc (\~{}21{\textdegree}N) had high retention levels during the entire year. Larvae transported from the coast to the archipelago came mainly from the area located between Cape Ghir (\~{}30{\textdegree}38'N) and Cape Juby, whereas larvae retained in the eddy field downstream of the islands originated mainly from the area between Cape Juby to Dakhla (\~{}24{\textdegree}N). The results are discussed in relation to available field data of anchovy and sardine egg distributions over the continental shelf, and compared with oceanic surveys of larval presence near the Canary archipelago.},

These {IBMs} have focused on early life history stages (eggs through to post-larvae) as it is thought that variations in anchovy recruitment strength are primarily driven by biological and/or physical factors impacting on these stages. The pelagic zone of the Benguela system constitutes an ideal system for studying the coupling between biological and physical processes; in the {IBMs} this coupling is obtained by releasing particles endowed with biological properties in the virtual currents resulting from the output of a hydrodynamic model of the southwestern coast of South Africa. The particles are tracked through virtual time and space and their final locations are assessed in terms of previously defined criteria deemed to promote successful recruitment. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis of the results of {IBMs} of the early stages of anchovy in the southern Benguela constructed to date. Emphasis is placed on the methodological aspects of these studies and on the sequential link of several simulation experiments of increasing complexity. In addition to improving understanding, such an approach allows for effective interplay between modelling experiments and surveys or laboratory experiments.

By coupling the {IBM} to a 3D hydrodynamic model of the region called Plume, and by varying parameters such as the spatial and temporal location of spawning, particle buoyancy, and the depth range over which particles were released, we could assess the influences of these parameters on transport success. A sensitivity analysis using a General Linear Model identified the primary determinants of transport success in the various experimental simulations, and model outputs were examined and compared with patterns observed in field studies. Model outputs compared well with observed patterns of vertical and horizontal egg distribution. Particle buoyancy and area of particle release were the major single determinants of transport success, with an egg density of 1.025 g cm-3 maximizing average particle transport success and the western Agulhas Bank being the most successful spawning area.
